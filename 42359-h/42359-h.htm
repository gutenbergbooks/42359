<h2 class="space-above"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"><i>PREFACE.</i></a></h2>


<p>No part of the world possesses so many charms for the
contemplative mind as the admirable scenery of our
English Lake District. None can furnish so wide a field
for the excursions of a playful imagination, as those
peaceful glens which are formed by the fantastic sweeps
of our northern mountains.</p>

<p>The lover of nature, whose delight it is to traverse this
romantic region, beholds here scenes the most lovely
opening out on every hand. Mountains and dales wild
enough, in all conscience, amidst which are hidden placid,
silver lakes, embosomed in the most delicious, fairyland
valleys, diversified with beautiful mansions, and snow-white
cottages, nestling in all the luxuriance of their native
woods and coppices.</p>

<p>It has been justly said that the district from Lancaster,
and the Bay of Morecambe, to the borders of Scotland,
includes in its territory the richest valleys, the wildest
mountains, the dreariest moorlands, the greenest meadows,
the most barren rocks, the thickest and most verdant woods,
the sweetest towns and villages, the smoothest rivers, which
the salmon loves to haunt; the most turbulent mountain
streams, in whose dark pools, here and there, the speckled
trout finds a dwelling-place; the gayest garden flowers, the
loveliest heaths that ever grew wild, high hills, deep mines,
noble families, and the loveliest maidens of the land.</p>

<p>Whether we contemplate the sublime grandeur of its
mountains, or listen to the melodious murmurs of the
distant waterfalls, or meditate along the margins of its
woodland streams in the evening's calm, we must be
enchanted with the scene, and feel fully prepared to exclaim
with the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lives there a man with soul so dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As never to himself hath said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is my own, my native land!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Lake District has long been regarded as the romantic
"classic ground" of England. The Tour of Gray and
others formerly, and the works and residence of some of
the most celebrated poets of our day, have thrown a "sacred
halo" around it in the eye of the stranger, endeared as it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
by living and departed genius; and have exalted the
enthusiasm with which the visitor surveys a region that
embodies more variety of charming scenery, and of
picturesque magnificence, than an equal space of our own
or of any other country. In extent, indeed, the sister
kingdoms may surpass it, but not in beauty; and, save in
their "diadem of snow," its mountains may be said to rival
the sublimity of the Alps, without their vastness. Where,
in all Europe, in all the wide world, can more lovely and
enchanting spots be found than are embosomed amongst the
lakes and mountains of Cumberland and Westmorland?</p>

<p>The increased and increasing facilities afforded for visiting
the unrivalled scenery of the Lake district, naturally excite
a corresponding desire to supply the tourist with every
incident connected with this interesting locality.</p>

<p>The great number of popular publications as Guides and
Tours to the Lakes, which, at different intervals, have been
eagerly received, is a striking proof of the patriotic interest
that attaches to the district. These, though they are, many
of them, replete with valuable information, and render the
traveller much necessary aid, are most of them deficient in
their allusion to the history and traditions of some of the
more remarkable sites of this romantic region.</p>

<p>To supply this deficiency, in part, is the object of the present
Work. The interest of a country abounding in spots the
most attractive in themselves, is greatly enhanced by the
local associations attaching to it, its connection with bygone
days, be they of the historical or legendary kind; for,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Holier seems the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To him who catches on the gale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The spirit of a mournful tale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Embodied in the sound."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In the following pages are narrated a few of the romantic
stories the country affords. The district, it is true, is not
particularly rich in historical incidents; nor has it been the
scene of many great events; yet, it has been justly said by
a popular writer, what it wants in history it more than
makes up in poetry.</p>

<p>True, it may appear to be richer in scenery than in
legend, and in poetry than romance; but, the fact is, its
legends and romance have been neglected. The district is
highly suggestive of both, but it has had no Sir Walter Scott
to make the most of them. A part of the land so famous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>
for beauty and for song, independent of its Border
proximity, is one peculiarly favourable to the lovers of old
legends; its atmosphere is one in which fancy most delights
to soar and to hover, and it contains a mine of materials for
romance yet almost untouched.</p>

<p>The fierce feuds and stormful outgoings of the adjoining
Borders, are full of interest and of romance peculiar to
themselves. "Battles have assailed the banks" of nearly
every stream&mdash;some of the strongholds yet remain, wherein
the mosstroopers, clad in steel from head to foot, issued
forth in the morning light&mdash;the hills are there, with the
heath, across which they sped on gallant steeds, with lances
outstretched, and gleaming helmets&mdash;the paths are yet green
amid the dun moor along which they drove their spoil&mdash;and
in solitary farm-houses, or lonely cottages, ancient
dames may yet be met with, who can repeat, in song or
story, the wild deeds which their mothers saw, and their
sires performed.</p>

<p>Once there were more castles than churches in the
country, to defend it from the Scot; and though these
castles now, for the most part, stand solitary monuments
of past ages and conditions of things, yet around them still
linger the fame of heroic deeds, and the twilight melancholy
of once absorbing woes. Besides its many other interesting
monuments of antiquity, 'tis not without its aged monasteries
and "ivy-mantled towers."</p>

<p>It has been truly said the spirit of romance is departing
from the land in which we dwell. Our forests are felled
where the freebooters of former days flourished&mdash;the fish
are chased from our lakes by steamboats&mdash;the hills of heath,
where the deer roved, are enclosed, and ploughed and
harrowed over periodically&mdash;the green slopes and dusky
dells, where nobles chased the roe, and the sunny glades of
the forest into which they emerged, with gallant trains
and bridles ringing, and their hunting gear glittering in the
glorious sunlight of the olden time&mdash;all these are gone;
and as we wander over the land, we find mostly drains and
furrows, stone dykes, and straight fences, where the heather
hung its blue bells unseen from year to year, save by the
gorcock or the hare, or the myriads of wild bees that circled
round the breathing flowers, and, humming within their tiny
cells, sought out the sweet treasures which nature had hidden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>
there. Our castles and abbeys are in ruins&mdash;our Border-keeps
are mouldering to the ground&mdash;the battle grounds
have been torn up by the plough&mdash;our briery glens and leafy
shaws, consecrated by immortal song to past loves, have been
ruthlessly desecrated&mdash;our ancient sports are at an end&mdash;we
are a changed people&mdash;and the olden time is truly gone.</p>

<p>Let it never be thought that we rejoice not in the present
because we regret the past. We feel, and are thankful for
the blessings and comforts which the improved arts of the
age impart to us; we exult in the progress of science
throughout the land; we can even look with complacency
upon a railroad, though it intersect, with its prosaic line,
the woodlands where we first felt the poetry of life&mdash;though
the very hawthorn, beneath which we breathed our
vows of eternal fidelity to her who now lies nightly in our
bosom, has been rooted up to prepare a path for it.</p>

<p>We see all this, and we think of it without regret. Our
reason approving, consents to it; yet our imagination
answers, "The spirit of romance is departing from us, and
we sigh for the olden time."</p>

<p>Imagination is a faculty in which we delight, and
phrenologists say that men are happy only in the active
exercise of their faculties. Therefore it is, that, leaving
the practical speculations of the arts and sciences, we have
chosen to select a field wherein imagination may fly her
boldest flight, and we have allowed our fancy to rove amid
scenes of fictitious bliss or woe, or amidst the real sorrows
and joys of many an "owre true tale."</p>

<p>I only add that, should the pleasure of the tourist be
enhanced by a perusal of any of the following tales connected
with the Lake district, it will confer a still greater pleasure
on the writer, even than that of culling them, from time to
time, during his visits to those nooks hallowed by poetry,
or consecrated by history, which a frequent residence in
this locality has afforded him the opportunity of exploring.
They are offered to the lover of nature, and to the admirer
of the picturesque, with the hope that, whilst delighting in
nature's sublimities, which are self-evident, proclaiming, at
every step, their Divine original, he may not pass by
unheeded some of the remarkable spots of history or
romance without feeling interested in their associations.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-3">T</span>HOUGH ample testimony is borne to the simple and
engaging manners of the Lake residents, I must confess
there is a little Vandalism among them. They do not
feel that generous love and veneration for the glorious
remains of other years which ought to warm the breast
of every Englishman. My uncle was indignant at the
inattention paid to the scattered ruins of Penrith Castle.</p>

<p>"The Turks," he observed, "could only have turned the
ruined habitations of the Christian nobles into cattle-sheds
and pigstyes!"</p>

<p>We sat ourselves down at the edge of the moat, where
the disgusting inroads of modern improvements would least
obtrude themselves on our view, to contemplate the ruined
strength and fallen grandeur of our ancestors. We were
scarcely seated when an elderly gentleman, on whose
countenance a cheerful good nature was visibly impressed,
approached us. My uncle invited him to take a seat on our
green sofa, with which invitation he smilingly complied.</p>

<p>My uncle, whose ideas were at least two centuries old,
opened the conversation by an allusion to those times when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
our old northern castles shone in all their splendour; and
their inhabitants possessed their original power.</p>

<p>"How much of their outward dignity have the higher
classes lost," observed my uncle, "since literature and commerce
have shed their genial influence on our favoured isle."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the stranger; "and how much have the
lower classes been elevated since that period. The ranks of
society are less distinct; and the system of equality is
perhaps as nearly realised as the well-being of society could
admit."</p>

<p>"In some respects it may be so," said my father; "but I
think that we might yet dispense with some of that pride
which separates man from his brother man."</p>

<p>"If one may believe report," said my sister, "there was
more love in former times than there is now. People were
kinder then; men were more faithful; and unions in general
more happy than they are at present."</p>

<p>"I can tell you a story on that subject," replied the
stranger, "which will be interesting to the young people,
and I hope no way disagreeable to old ones. For I count
the person who cannot sympathise in a love story to be
unfit for any social duty, and calculated for nothing but
the cloister or the cell."</p>

<p>"By all means," exclaimed my sister, "let us hear it. If
there be anything about the firm faith of a female heart, it
will be pleasing."</p>

<p>"If there be anything," said my uncle, "about the
manners of our ancestors, it will be instructive."</p>

<p>"If there be anything," said my father, "about the villany
of man in it, it must be true."</p>

<p>"There will be something about all these," replied the
stranger, and he now related the story.</p>

<p>It was customary in the times to which I allude, said our
garrulous acquaintance, for the owners of these old halls
and castles to retain each a jester in his mansion, called by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
the common people a fool. According to custom Sir Allan
Pennington had a jester, whose name was Thomas Skelton,
but whose common appellation was Tom Fool of Muncaster.
But I shall have occasion to mention him in the course of
my story; as he performed a tragical part in it&mdash;rather too
much so, to be enumerated among the drolleries of a common
jester. I will, however, give you the tale as I have often
heard the parson repeat it to an old maiden aunt of mine,
with whom I was brought up; and who never heard it
without a copious flow of tears.</p>

<p>The morning was most delightful (this was the parson's
uniform way of introducing the story), when the level
beams of the sun first gleamed on the smooth surface of
Devoke Water, and informed the joyous villagers that it
was the First of May. The wooden clogs were stripped
from the feet of the blooming damsels, and the leathern
shoes, which had been carefully preserved from the preceding
year, and many of which had adorned the feet of their
mothers and grandmothers, were taken out of the paper
which enveloped them. The oil with which they had been
rubbed twelve months before was polished by the warm
hand to a fine gloss. Every garden was robbed of its
bloom to form garlands and chaplets in order to beautify
what could not be beautified; for what&mdash;the parson would
say, looking languishingly at my aunt&mdash;could add beauty
to a Cumberland maiden?</p>

<p>The Maypole was reared in a delightful meadow on the
banks of Devoke Water; and the maidens blooming in
beauty, and the youths bounding in health, repaired thither
from the surrounding cottages. As the festive dance commenced,
the soul of innocent gaiety began to expand. The
festoons of flowers waving from the Maypole, and the
garlands of the damsels, all gently agitated by a slight
breeze, gave a gracefulness to the scene which no language
can describe. It seemed as if the exhilarating breath of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
spring gave elasticity to the youthful limb, and a higher
zest to the spirits, as the lively music gave emotion to the
nimble feet of the light-footed dancers.</p>

<p>At the first pause in the dance every eye was attracted
towards a most heavenly maiden, attired in the simple garb
of a Cumberland shepherdess. She came tripping along the
meadow in the full glow of her beauty, and, with a smile,
joined the maiden circle. Every tongue was inquiring,
"Wha is she?"&mdash;and every eye was eager to obtain a
glance of her charms. Several of the most respectable
shepherds offered to lead her to the dance, but she modestly
refused. Among the rest Wild Will of Whitbeck, as he was
generally called, urged her to favour him with her hand.</p>

<p>"I only came," said she, "to be a spectator of these
innocent gaities; and, should I share in them, I should wish
to procure a more modest partner."</p>

<p>"A modest partner!" exclaimed Will, "yan et darn't luik
at ya: yan etle stand eating his thooms, and just whisperen
la doon, 'will ya dance?' A poor feckless thing et darn't
lait a sweetheart withoot its minny ga wi' it."</p>

<p>"You will please to leave me, shepherd," replied the maid,
"and carry your raillery to other ears where it may be
more agreeable."</p>

<p>"I'll hev a kiss furst," said Will, "for that canny feace
and filed tongue hez quite laid ma ith brears."</p>

<p>"Forbear your rudeness, for God's sake," cried the damsel;
"or you may repent it."</p>

<p>"By all the powers af love and beauty," exclaimed the
carpenter's son, stepping up at that moment, "unless he
stands off he shall repent it. Will you take a dance with
me, fair maiden?"</p>

<p>She willingly complied. But the elder and more experienced
part of the company said they observed a glance
pass between them, which said they had met before. This
renewed the inquiry who the damsel might be, but in vain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Will retired in a gloomy rage, swearing that he would discover
who the girl was, and have revenge on the carpenter,
if it cost him his life.</p>

<p>The lovers heard not his threats, but repaired to the Maypole;
and, as they danced around it, sang the following
roundelay:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"What are monarchs' courts, my dear?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can their splendour yield them bliss?<br /></span>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>Various were the conjectures respecting the unknown
shepherdess; though all the country maids agreed that she
was not what she seemed.</p>

<p>"Be wha she will," said Wild Will of Whitbeck, "I'll
hunt it oot."</p>

<p>"She's niver worth it," observed a girl, who probably
thought Will might employ his time better. But Will was
not to be driven from his purpose. And some of those who
had been refused by the fair unknown urged Will to make
his promise good. Therefore, when the evening drew on,
and the young people began to pair off towards home, Will,
and two of his companions who were not more agreeably
occupied, followed Richard, the carpenter's son, and his
lovely partner, towards home. But little did they expect
to see her sheltered in Muncaster Hall. As the lovers stood
exchanging vows of eternal constancy at the garden gate,
their pursuers heard enough to inform them that the maid
was Helwise, daughter of Sir Allan Pennington; and to
convince them that their faith was mutually plighted.</p>

<p>"Noo," said Will, "I hev him o' the hip. For Sir
Ferdinand Hoddleston, of Millum Castle, wants et wed that
leddy; an' if I yance let him kna et this silly carpenter
follows her, he'll meak an example on him."</p>

<p>When Will informed the neighbours next Sunday
of his discovery, they were struck with astonishment
at the handsome young carpenter's audacity, as they
termed it. The young women hoped and trusted that
Sir Allan would never know; for it would be a pity
that so nice a young man should be hanged&mdash;as he was
sure to be, if Sir Allan knew that he courted his daughter.
At the same time they thought he might have been
content with one of the shepherd girls; yet it was
hard he should be hanged for love. He deserved to
be sent out of the country, the young men observed.
The maidens thought it would be a pity to send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
him away; but they might put him in a nunnery, or something
of that sort.</p>

<p>Wild Will of Whitbeck gave no opinion on the subject&mdash;his
plans were deeper. He knew Sir Ferdinand and his
temper well. He had often attended him in his sporting
excursions; and, owing to his never-failing flow of rustic
wit, could any time find admittance at Millum Castle, where
his drolleries would beguile Sir Ferdinand of a melancholy
hour. Will, therefore, adopted this plan to make Sir
Ferdinand the avenger of the insult he had received from
the carpenter, and the repulse he had met with from the
lovely Helwise.</p>

<p>"We had fine spooart o'th first o' May," said Will; "but
I got cruel ill vext."</p>

<p>"What happened to vex thee?" inquired Sir Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"Wya, ye see," said Will, "Sir Allan's daughter donned
hersell like a country hoody, an thought et naebody could
a kent her, but I kent her weel eneugh."</p>

<p>"And did that vex thee?" replied Sir Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"I sa her," replied Will, "an mear oor an' that, I followed
em heam, an sa em give yan another a kiss. When she put
her arms roond his neck, I war stark wood. What! war
Dick better ner me?"</p>

<p>The train was now laid. Will had roused Sir Ferdinand's
vengeance, without giving the least hint that he suspected
such a thing.</p>

<p>"Shall I!" exclaimed Sir Ferdinand, as soon as Will had
retired, "Shall I be made a fool of by a carpenter's son?
Shall such a wretch as that presume to be my rival in the
affections of the loveliest maid in Cumberland? Curse the idea!
He shall be taught to know his duty better. No, I scorn
to apply to Sir Allan. I will be my own avenger. Were
he removed I should be at peace. That will do. He dies!"</p>

<p>Once resolved, Sir Ferdinand felt no rest till his scheme
was accomplished. The morning had scarcely dawned till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
he mounted and rode for Muncaster Hall. Few of the
family were stirring when Sir Ferdinand arrived. Tom
Fool, however, was up, and hastened to meet the knight, who
had often expressed himself pleased with Tom's rustic wit.</p>

<p>"Good morning, Tom," said Sir Ferdinand, "what makes
you laugh so this morning, Tom?"</p>

<p>"Lord Lucy's footman," replied Tom, "put a trick on
me the last time he was here; and I have been paying him
back what I owed him, for I would be in no man's debt."</p>

<p>"How hast thou managed thy revenge?" returned Sir
Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"He asked me," said Tom, "if the river was passable;
and I told him it was, for nine of our family had just gone
over. ('They were nine geese,' whispered Tom, 'but I did
not tell him that.') The fool set into the river, and would
have been drowned, I believe, if I had not helped him out."</p>

<p>"If thou'lt revenge me of a scoundrel who lives here,"
said Sir Ferdinand, "I'll make a man of thee."</p>

<p>"You'll do what Sir Allan could never do, then," replied
Tom, with a laugh. "But who is it, pray?"</p>

<p>"'Tis the carpenter," replied the knight.</p>

<p>"I owe him a grudge, too," said Tom; "for I put those
three shillings which you gave me into a hole, and I found
them weezend every time I went to look at them; and now
they are only three silver pennies. I have just found out
that Dick has weezend them."</p>

<p>"Then kill him, Tom, with his own axe, when he is
asleep sometime; and I'll see that thou takes no harm for
it," replied Sir Ferdinand.</p>

<p>"He deserves it, and I'll do it," said Tom.</p>

<p>"There's three crowns for thee," said Sir Ferdinand, "and
he'll not weezen them, if thou follow my advice."</p>

<p>Tom wanted no further inducement. His own injuries,
and the hopes of reward from Sir Ferdinand soon influenced
him. And the next day, while the unsuspecting carpenter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
was taking his after-dinner nap, and dreaming probably of
the incomparable beauties of his adorable Helwise, Tom
entered the shed, and, with one blow of the axe, severed the
carpenter's head from his body.</p>

<p>"There," said Tom to the servants, "I have hid Dick's
head under a heap of shavings; and he will not find that
so easily, when he awakes, as he did my shillings."</p>

<p>Sir Ferdinand was grievously disappointed in his scheme;
for the lovely Helwise had buried her heart in the same
grave that held the remains of her sleeping lover. It was
in vain that Sir Ferdinand urged the tenderness and sincerity
of his passion. She was deaf to his entreaties. Her heart
was cold, and no human power could warm it. The noisy
mirth of the hall she could hear unmoved; the mazy
intricacies of the festive dance could not reanimate her;
the glowing beauties of the summer landscape were gloomy
and dull as December. She resolved to seclude herself
from the giddy world, and brood over her own sorrows in a
nunnery. She therefore retired to the Benedictine Convent
of Maiden Castle&mdash;the ruins of which are still visible
behind higher end of Soulby Fell; where she passed her
few remaining days in piety and silent solitude.</p>

<p>The conscience of Sir Ferdinand left him no repose; and,
to stifle recollections which became continually more
insupportable, he joined the army, and soon after fell in
the battle of Bosworth Field, fighting against the Earl of
Richmond. He left a very handsome estate in the neighbourhood
of Kirksancton to St. Mary's Abbey of Furness, to
purchase masses for the repose of his own soul, and the soul
of the young carpenter.</p>

<h2 class="space-above"><a name="ST_HERBERT" id="ST_HERBERT">ST. HERBERT,</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE HERMIT OF DERWENTWATER.</span></h2>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.png" width="42" height="70" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-1">A</span>MONGST the beautiful isles of Derwentwater, that
named St. Herbert's Island deserves a more than
ordinary notice, as well for its beauty as its historical
associations. This insulated paradise includes an
extent of four or five acres, well covered with wood, and is
situated near the centre of the lake. It obtained its name
from St. Herbert, a priest and confessor, who, "to avoid the
intercourse of man, and that nothing might withdraw his
attention from unceasing mortification and prayer," about the
middle of the 7th century, chose this island for his lonely abode.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i14">"St. Herbert hither came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here for many seasons, from the world<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Removed, and the affections of the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He dwelt in solitude."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The locality was well adapted to the severity of his religious
life; he was surrounded by the lake, from whence he
received his simple diet. On every hand the voice of
waterfalls excited the most solemn strains of meditation&mdash;rocks
and mountains were his daily prospect, inspiring his
mind with ideas of the might and majesty of the Creator.</p>

<p>That St. Herbert had his hermitage on this island is
certain from the authority of the venerable Bede, as well as
from tradition, and nowhere could ancient eremite find more
profound peace, or a place of so great beauty, whence to
bear on the wings of imagination his orisons to heaven.</p>

<p>St. Herbert was particularly distinguished for his friendship
to St. Cuthbert, bishop of Lindisfarne, with whom he
was contemporary; and, according to a legendary tale, at
the intercession of St. Herbert both these holy men expired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
on the same day, and in the same hour and minute, which,
according to Bede, was in 678 or 687.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At Lindisfarne, expecting death,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The good St. Cuthbert lay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With wasted frame and feeble breath;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The brotherhood had gathered round,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His parting words to hear,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His eyes grew dim; his voice sunk low;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The choral song arose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ere its sounds had ceas'd to flow,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His spirit found repose.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At that same hour, a holy man,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">St. Herbert, well renown'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gave token that his earthly span<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had reach'd its utmost bound.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">St. Cuthbert, in his early years,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Had led him on his way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the tree falls, the fruit it bears<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will surely, too, decay.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The monks of Lindisfarne meanwhile,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Were gazing on their dead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At that same hour, in Derwent isle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A kindred soul had fled.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There is but little information on record respecting St.
Herbert, and had it not been for his intimacy with St.
Cuthbert, his name probably would not have been handed
down to posterity at all. In truth, he did little more than
pray and meditate on this spot. It was his wish to live and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
die unknown. Though one in spirit, St. Cuthbert and the
Hermit of Derwentwater were entirely dissimilar in character.
St. Cuthbert was bishop of Lindisfarne, an eminent preacher
in his day, whose eloquence influenced the will of many,
and whose active zeal contributed to the advancement of
the then dominant church, of which he was one of the main
pillars and rulers. St. Herbert was altogether a man of
prayer. He retired from the world to this solitude, and
passed his days in devotion. The two saints used to meet
once a year for spiritual communion. Which had most
influence with the Ruler of heaven we cannot say.</p>

<p>The venerable Bede writes thus of the Hermit of Derwentwater:&mdash;"There
was a certain priest, revered for his
uprightness and perfect life and manners, named Herberte,
who had a long time been in union with the man of God
(St. Cuthbert of Farn Isle), in the bond of spiritual love
and friendship. For living a solitary life in the isle of that
great and extended lake, from whence proceeds the river of
Derwent, he used to visit St. Cuthbert every year, to receive
from his lips the doctrine of eternal life. When this holy
priest heard of St. Cuthbert's coming to Lugubalia, he came
after his usual manner, desiring to be comforted more and
more, with the hope of everlasting blisse, by his divine
exhortations. As they sate together, and enjoyed the hopes
of heaven, among other things the bishop said:</p>

<p>"'Remember, brother, Herberte, that whatsoever ye have
to say and ask of me, you do it now, for after we depart
hence, we shall not meet again, and see one another corporally
in this world; for I know well the time of my dissolution
is at hand, and the laying aside of this earthly tabernacle
draweth on apace.'</p>

<p>"When Herberte heard this, he fell down at his feet, and
with many sighs and tears beseeched him, for the love of
the Lord, that he would not forsake him, but to remember
his faithful brother and associate, and make intercession<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
with the gracious God, that they might depart hence into
heaven together, to behold His grace and glory whom they
had in unity of spirit served on earth; for you know I
have ever studied and laboured to live according to your
pious and virtuous instructions; and in whatsoever I
offended or omitted, through ignorance and frailty, I straight-way
used my earnest efforts to amend after your ghostly
counsel, will, and judgment. At this earnest and affectionate
request of Herbertes, the bishop went to prayer, and
presently being certified in spirit that his petition to heaven
would be granted,&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Arise,' said he, 'my dear brother, weep not, but let your
rejoicing be with exceeding gladness, for the great mercy
of God hath granted unto us our prayer.'</p>

<p>"The truth of which promise and prophecy was well
proved in that which ensued; for their separation was the
last that befel them on earth; on the same day, which was
the 19th day of March, their souls departed from their
bodies, and were straight in union in the beatific sight and
vision; and were transported hence to the kingdom of
heaven, by the service and hands of angels."</p>

<p>It is probable the hermit's little oratory or chapel might
be kept in repair after his death, as a particular veneration
appears to have been paid to this retreat, and the memory
of the saint; for, at the distance of almost seven centuries,
we find this place resorted to in holy services and processions,
and the hermit's memory celebrated in religious offices.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
The remains of the hermitage are still visible; and near to
these hallowed ruins stands a small grotto of unhewn stone,
called the New Hermitage, erected some years ago by Sir
Wilfrid Lawson, to whose representative the island at
present belongs. The dwelling of the anchorite consisted
of two apartments, one of which, about twenty feet in
length by sixteen in width, appears to have been his
chapel; the other, whose dimensions are considerably less,
was his cell.</p>

<p>The passion for solitude and a recluse life which reigned
in the days of this saint, and was cherished by the monastic
school, at first sight may appear to us uncouth and
enthusiastic; yet when we examine into those times, our
astonishment will cease, if we consider the estate of those
men, who, under all the prejudices of education, were living
in an age of ignorance, vassalage, and rapine; and we shall
rather applaud than condemn a devotee, who, disgusted
with the world and the sins of men, consigns his life to the
service of the Deity in retirement. We may suppose we
hear the saint exclaiming with the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If thou, in the dear love of some one friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hast been so happy that thou know'st what thoughts<br /></span>

<span class="smaller">A TALE OF FURNESS ABBEY.</span></h2>


<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-2">I</span> &nbsp;CAN just remember the circumstance; it happened
when I was a boy and went to Urswick school.
Matilda&mdash;I will not mention her other name, because
her friends are still living&mdash;Matilda was one of the
loveliest females I ever knew. Her father had a small estate
at &mdash;&mdash;, near Stainton; and she being his only child, he fondly
imagined that her beauty and her fortune would procure her
a respectable match. But alas! how often do your parents
err in their calculations on the happiness which, they fondly
imagine, will arise from the conduct of their children!</p>

<p>Matilda had accompanied James, a neighbouring farmer's
son, to school, when infancy gave room to no other thoughts
but those of play. James had ever distinguished the lovely
Matilda for his playmate; for her he had collected the
deepest tinged May gowlings that grew in the meadows
below the village; he spared no pains to procure the finest
specimens of hawthorn blossoms, to place in her bonnet;
and would artlessly compliment her on her appearance
under the flowery wreath. He was always ready to assist
her in conning her lessons at school, and oftener wrought
her questions than she did herself.</p>

<p>At an early age James was removed from school, and
bound to an Ulverstone trader. Matilda and James met
or heard of each other no more, till he had completed his
eighteenth year, and the hard and active service in which
he was employed had given his fine manly form an appearance
at once imposing and captivating. Matilda, too, was
improved in every eye, but particularly in James'. Never
had James seen so lovely a maid as his former playmate.
That friendship which had been so closely cemented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
infancy, required very little assistance from the blind god
to ripen it into love. Their youthful hearts were disengaged;
they had neither of them ever felt an interest for any
person, equal to what they had felt for each other; and they
soon resolved to render their attachment as binding and as
permanent, as it was pure and undivided.</p>

<p>The period had arrived when James must again trust
himself to the faithless deep, when he must leave his Matilda
to have her fidelity tried by other suitors; and she must
trust her James to the temptation of foreign beauties. Both,
therefore, were willing to bind themselves by some solemn
pledge to live but for each other.</p>

<p>For this purpose, they repaired, on the evening before
James' departure, to the ruins of Furness Abbey. It was a
fine autumnal evening; the sun had set in the greatest
beauty; and the moon was hastening up the eastern sky,
through a track slightly interspersed with thin fleecy clouds,
which added to its beauty, rather than impaired it. They
knelt in the roofless quire, near where the altar formerly
stood; and, fondly locked in each other's arms, they repeated,
in the presence of heaven, their vows of deathless love.
James was dressed in his best seaman's dress&mdash;a blue jacket,
with a multitude of silver-plated buttons, and white
trowsers; while Matilda leaned on his neck in a dress of
the purest white muslin, carelessly wrapped in a shawl of
light blue.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular, said the narrator in describing
their dresses, because this is the picture I would paint:&mdash;I
would sketch an east view of the abbey, looking in at the
large east window, where two lovers were kneeling, folded
in each other's arms&mdash;the moonbeams just striking upon the
most prominent parts of their figures&mdash;the deep shadows
occasioned by the broken columns and scattered fragments,
should recede into the distance&mdash;the dark gray ruins, and
the deep green and brown of the oaks, slightly but brilliantly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
gilded by the moon, should peep out of the lengthened
gloom with sparkling effect. But on the figures I would
bestow the greatest attention. What manly vigour I
would give to his attitude! What sweetness, what loveliness
to hers!</p>

<p>But what became of the betrothed lovers? Their fate
was a melancholy one. James returned to his ship, and
never returned from his voyage. He was killed by the first
broadside of a French privateer, which the captain foolishly
ventured to engage with. For Matilda, she regularly went
to the Abbey to visit the spot where she last saw him;
and there she would stand for hours, with her hands clasped
on her breast, gazing on that heaven which alone had been
witness to their mutual vows. Indeed, I think this would
make a picture almost equal to the other. How fine a
contrast would the light and fairy form of Matilda make
with the broken fragments of the ruined Abbey; it would
give a life and effect to the picture which you have no
conception of. I am confident if you once drew a picture
of this kind, you would never again sketch a scene without
a story to it.</p>

<span class="smaller">OR, THE POET OF KENTMERE.</span></h2>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-4">C</span>HARLES WILLIAMS was one of those individuals
who are "born to blush unseen." It is probable,
therefore, that his name is unknown, and that his
merits might have slept in obscurity but for us. We
suspect that he has never been heard of before, and it is
very likely that he never will be again. Charles had no
long line of ancestors whose merits he could impute to
himself. His great-grandfather had, to be sure, been the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
most noted wrestler in his day; and had annually won the
belt at Bowness and at Keswick, but his prowess was forgot
by all but his immediate descendants; and even his hard-earned
belts had long since been cut up for repairing cart
gear. Though Charles was only the son of a small farmer,
yet there was one thing on which the family prided itself&mdash;there
was a W. W. over the kitchen door which</p>

<p>"Was a sartan sign," his mother argued, "et that hoos hed
belengd to them sometime lang sen."</p>

<p>There was one circumstance which we ought not to omit;
particularly as it excited no inconsiderable interest, at the
time, through all the neighbourhood of Kentmere. On the
very day, and as far as we can ascertain, at the very hour,
when Charles was born, a huge stone, self-moved, rolled
down Wallow Crag into Hawes Water! The old women
could and would account for it no other way than that he
was born to be droond. Mr. Gough, who was then beginning
to exhibit the first dawning of that genius which has procured
him the esteem and admiration of all true lovers of rational
philosophy, would gladly have convinced them that it was
nothing but the effects of a thaw which had taken place
only a few days before. But they argued that</p>

<p>"Thear hed been many a tha afoar, but niver a stane
rolled doon Wallow Crag afoar."</p>

<p>Charles however grew up to be a boy, just as if this
ominous stone had continued to sit secure on the mountain's
ridge. But it might be said of him that "a strange and
wayward wight was he." While other boys were ranging
through the woods in pursuit of bird-nests, Charles would
stretch himself on a smooth-faced rock, and pore on the
adjacent landscape like one half crazed. To retire into a
lonely wood behind his father's house, and teach a little
brook, which ran through it, to take a thousand fantastic
forms, was to Charles the sweetest recreation he could enjoy.
The perpetual wings of time had now spread fifteen or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
sixteen winters over the vale of Kentmere, since the stone
rolled into Hawes Water, and Charles was grown a tall and
graceful boy. The little time which his father had spared
him to school, had not been misemployed by the active
youth; and though he felt a diffidence about entering into
conversation, it was generally allowed that, when he did
unloosen his tongue, he could argue any man in the valley,
except the parson, who never stopt to hear anybody
speak but himself, and the schoolmaster, who never spoke
at all.</p>

<p>One evening about this time, as Charles was returning
from an accustomed ramble, where he had been enjoying a
view of the mist slowly gathering among the mountain
heads to the north, he was aroused from his reverie by a
shrill scream; a young female had been pursuing a footpath
over the adjoining field, and was at that instant closely
followed by a neighbour's bull. Charles, with the speed of
lightning, was at the girl's side; and, with a presence of
mind oftener found in boys than men, he snatched the
umbrella out of her hand, and unfurled it in the enraged
animal's face. The astonished beast retreated a few paces,
and, according to a standing rule among mad bulls, having
been foiled in its first attempt, it did not make a second
attack.</p>

<p>Charles, with that gallantry which is a concomitant of
generous minds, proposed to see the affrighted maid to her
father's dwelling. Maria was a girl whom Charles had
known from her infancy; he had played with her at school,
but he never before observed that she possessed anything
superior to the other girls of the dale. But this evening, as
she hung on his arm and thanked him with such a pair of
soft blue eyes so kindly&mdash;as the colour varied so often on
her cheek&mdash;and her bosom throbbed so agitatedly, he
discovered that Maria possessed more charms than all the
valley beside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>This evening's adventure formed an epoch in the life of
Charles Williams. All his actions were now influenced by
one all-powerful impulse. Ardent in his admiration of
nature's charms, that ardour was now transferred from the
general beauties of creation to the particular beauties of
the lovely Maria. Indeed, Maria was peculiarly formed
to please the fancy, and captivate the heart, of a youth like
Charles. There was a symmetry in her limbs, an elegance
in her person, and a simple gracefulness in her motions,
which rendered her an agreeable object even to the most
indifferent observer. But the charms of her mind were
the gems on which be placed the highest value. There was
a sombre shade of seriousness, perfectly distinct from
melancholy, which none could behold without feeling
interested. This seriousness, however, had nothing in it
inimical to that lively joyance which gives so delicious a
zest to our youthful days.</p>

<p>She even possessed a vivacity that accompanied all her
actions, and threw her real character into the distance.
Though endued with the keenest sensibility, she appeared
all life and gaiety. Wherever she was, she was the soul of
the little company&mdash;her lively wit and her smiling beauty
procured her attention wherever she showed herself. This
beautiful mixture of the gay and the grave assumed, on
some occasions, such strange contrasts, that she seemed to
be composed of inconsistencies. Often in her little evening
rambles with her young companions, after having put them
all in good humour with themselves and with one another,
by her little flattering railleries and harmless frolics, she
would in an instant bound away from the group with the
elastic grace of a mountain nymph&mdash;abruptly enter the
cottage of some sick or suffering neighbour, with a smile on
her countenance, like the angel of comfort charged with
blessings, kindly inquire after their various wants and
distresses, soothe them with consolatory hopes of better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
days, offer all those little assistances which old and
decaying age accepts so gratefully at the hands of youth,
and after mingling a sigh or a tear with theirs, again join
her gay companions as though nothing had occurred.</p>

<p>In the innocent society of this amiable maiden, Charles
passed the sweetest hours of his existence. His former
boyish pursuits were renounced. The windmill, on a rock
at a little distance, though nearly matured, was never
completed; the water-works in the wood were permitted to
run to ruin, even the perpetual motion in the room over the
old kitchen, which was in a state of great forwardness, was
neglected for a time, and eventually relinquished.</p>

<p>It is supposed, our intelligent correspondent says, that if
Charles had never been in love, it is probable that he had
never been a poet. And in confirmation of this idea, we
observe that his first productions are of the amatory kind&mdash;"odes
to beauty," "lines to Maria," "acrostics," &amp;c. Among
these fragments, we found a little airy piece without a head
but we suppose intended for Maria:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If all the world was made of kisses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all those kisses were made for me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I was made for you, my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How happy we should be!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">If all the graces were join'd in one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the wit and beauty too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'd make a maid like you, my love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They'd make a maid like you!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Some of his lyric pieces exhibit a strange mixture of
philosophy and passion, learning and love. In the eleventh
page of the manuscript before us, we find as curious a specimen
of this kind as we ever recollect. It is much interlined
and seems never to have been finished.</p>

<p>But the tender passion does not seem to have engrossed
all his poetical powers, as we find several pieces both grave
and gay on different subjects. One of these we shall select
as it seems to possess some originality, and has been
occasioned apparently by that influx of strangers which
generally enlivens the lake district during the summer
months; some of whom have probably noticed our mountain
bard, if we may judge from one of the stanzas.</p>

<p>Time, it is said, has wings; but Charles never observed
that it even moved, till he found himself in his twentieth
year. That love which at first sought only to relieve itself
in the society of its object, now began to assume a
determined character. But to any but lovers, the description
of love scenes would be irksome. It will be quite
sufficient if we hint at the affair, and leave our readers
to fill up the outline. We will only therefore assure them
on the best authority, that Charles set out no less than
three several times with a resolute determination to declare
the full extent of his passion, and solicit the fair hand of
Maria; and that as soon as he saw the maid, his purpose
"dissolved like the baseless fabric of a vision;" that Charles
at length conquered this timidity, and urged his suit with
such ardour, that he was heard afterwards to say he believed
love was like steam, the more it was compressed, the greater
was its elasticity; that Maria received the declaration with
all due bashfulness, and promised to be his bride as soon as
she had completed her twenty-first year; that Charles, as is
usual on such occasions, flew home on the wings of ecstasy,
&amp;c. It seems to have been about this time that the
following birthday ode was written&mdash;perhaps while he was
suffering under the effects of his own bashfulness:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>Our correspondent says he would be happy if he could
here conclude his narrative, as Sir Walter Scott does, with
a happy marriage; for however delightful the transition
from sorrow to joy may be, the reverse, even in description,
has no charms. But poor Charles was doomed to be hurled
from the height of his felicity to the lowest depths of
despair. The joyful promise had scarcely escaped the lovely
lips of Maria, and while her lover was yet giddy with his
joy, when the amiable maid was attacked by a severe illness,
which baffled all the doctor's skill. If entreaties for human
or divine aid could have prolonged the existence of the ill-fated
Maria, she had not died. Charles was ever at her
pillow&mdash;his studies were relinquished&mdash;his poetry was
neglected&mdash;and the dying Maria filled the whole extent of
his capacious mind. But all was vain; the grisly monster
Death had selected her as his victim, and he would not
quit his hold; he was deaf alike to the lamentations of a
parent, the regrets of friends, and the distractions of a
betrothed lover.</p>

<p>Though every succeeding morning showed how great was
the havoc that disease was making in her tender frame, and
the period of her suffering was evidently approaching,
Charles still hoped she would soon be well. If she was
more than usually debilitated, he observed that the fever
had left her, and she only wanted her strength recruiting,
and they would then renew their walks. If the hectic flush
overspread her cheeks, he hailed it as the sign of returning
health. And thus he hoped even against hope. His reason
would have convinced him she was dying, if reason had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
been allowed to speak; but he wished her to live, and he
would not stoop to think that she would die. Thus he
fulfilled the remarks of the poet&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"We join in the fraud, and ourselves we deceive,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What we wish to be true, love bids us believe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When at last the pale hue of death overspread her once-blooming
cheek, when she turned her languid eye towards
her lover and faltered "farewell," when she closed her faded
eyes and expired in prayer, Charles stood by the bedside
like a being bereft of power and motion. The deepest
despair overwhelmed him&mdash;his hopes were blasted&mdash;his fond
creation of future bliss was in an instant destroyed, and his
mind received a shock too powerful for nature to sustain.</p>

<p>From this moment a smile was never seen to illuminate
his features, the most gloomy and secluded places were his
favourite haunts. He avoided society as if the breath of
man was pestilential; and occupied his time in brooding
over his own melancholy. In his manuscript we find a
number of melancholy effusions, which were evidently
written about this time; and clearly bespeak a mind
bordering on the gloomy verge of insanity. But as they
are some of them by far the best pieces in the collection&mdash;a
proof that poetry and madness are nearly allied&mdash;we will
select two which tend to illustrate the awful state of the
writer's mind.</p>

<p>So far from having a salutary effect upon the mind of
Charles, time seems only to have increased the despondency
that had enveloped and clouded the reasoning faculties of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
our poet. We find, in a subsequent part of the volume, the
following lines, which show that his mind was giving way
under the pressure of acute distress:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ah! tell me not of busy life&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its bustling folly&mdash;joyless strife&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Can these dispel my care?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No&mdash;let me seek some cavern drear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where not a sound can meet my ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But groans of death, and shrieks of fear,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">The music of despair?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The black'ning storm, the driving rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall cool the fever in my brain,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And lull me to repose:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, when the thunders o'er me roll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spirits scream and goblins howl,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tempest shall compose my soul,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And cheat me of my woes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>About six months did Charles continue in this deplorable
condition, attracting the sympathy of all who beheld
him. And often when he passed the cottage doors, where,
in happier days, he had accompanied Maria on her errands
of benevolence, the objects of his former bounty would look
after him with a sigh, and say, "Poor Charles! Poor
Charles!"</p>

<p>Though he generally spent the day in rambling about the
woods and hills, the hour of his return seldom exceeded
that of nightfall. One evening, however, he delayed his
return; his parents made every enquiry, but in vain. He
had been seen on Harter-fell in the afternoon, but no
further tidings could be obtained. Early next morning the
melancholy suspicion was confirmed&mdash;he was found
drowned. It is rumoured in the vale, says our friend, but
he will not vouch for its truth, that he was found in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
very spot where the stone rolled down when he was born.
It appears that he had meditated this act from the following
lines, which shall conclude our extracts:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And what is death, that I should dread<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To mingle with the silent dead?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis but a pang&mdash;and pangs are o'er;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A throb&mdash;and throbbing is no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One struggle&mdash;and that one my last:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gasp&mdash;a groan&mdash;and all is past!"<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-3">T</span>HIS old mansion of Calgarth, on the banks of Lake
Windermere, is built much in the style of Levens and
Sizergh. Some of the rooms have been elegantly
finished; but, having been a long time in the
possession of farmers, who occupy but a part of it, it is much
gone out of repair, and has, on the whole, a melancholy
appearance. This circumstance, in concurrence with the
superstitious notions which have ever been common in
country places, and the particular mentioned hereafter, have
probably given rise to a report, which has long prevailed,
that the house is haunted. And many are the stories of
frightful visions and mischievous deeds which the goblins of
the place are said to have performed, to terrify and distress
the harmless neighbourhood. These fables are not yet
entirely disbelieved. Spectres still are seen, and there are
two human skulls, which have lain in the window of a
large room as long as can be remembered, whose history
and reputed properties are too singular not to contribute
something to this story of "the haunted house," and to let
them be passed over in this route.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>It has been a popular tale in these parts of immemorial
standing, that these skulls formerly belonged to two poor
old people, who were unjustly executed for a robbery; to
perpetuate their innocence, some ghost brought them there;
and that they are, for that end, indestructible, and in effect,
"immoveable." For, it is said, to what place soever they
were taken, or however used, they were still presently seen
again in their old dormitory, the window. As the report
goes, they have been buried, burned, powdered, and dispersed
in the winds, and upon the lake, several times, to no
purpose as to their removal and destruction: so far, says
common fame. Certain it is these human remains still
exist, and it would be thought an impeachment of the taste
and curiosity of the nymphs and swains of the neighbouring
villages, if they could not say they had once seen the
skulls of Calgarth.</p>

<p>As a more rational account of the matter (though still
lame and unsatisfactory), it is told by some, that there
formerly lived in the house a famous doctress, who had two
skeletons by her, for the usual purposes of her profession;
and the skulls happening to meet with better preservation
than the rest of the bones, they were accidentally honoured
with this singular notice. But, be their origin what it may,
their legend is too whimsical and improbable to deserve
being recorded, otherwise than as an instance of the never-failing
credulity of ignorance and superstition.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-4">E</span>DEN HALL, the seat of the chief of the famous border
clan of Musgrave, is a large and handsome edifice, on
the west bank of the river Eden, built in the taste which
prevailed about the time of the Charles's. Being
bordered with trees, it forms an elegant feature in the pleasure
grounds. There is here preserved, with scrupulous care, an
old and anciently-painted glass goblet, called the "Luck of
Edenhall," which would appear, from the following traditionary
legend, to be wedded to the fortunes of its present possessors.
The butler, in going to procure water at St. Cuthbert's well, in
the neighbourhood (rather an unusual employment for a
butler) came suddenly upon a company of fairies, who were
feasting and making merry on the green sward. In their
flight they left behind this glass, and one of them returning
for it, found it in the hands of the butler. Seeing that its
recovery was hopeless, she flew away, singing aloud&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If that glass should break or fall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell the luck of Eden Hall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The connection of the prosperity of the family with the
integrity of an inanimate object, has frequently been one of
the playthings of tradition, and traces of the superstition
are found in ancient fable. There is a legend of this kind
attached to a pear, preserved in a silver box at Coalstoun,
the seat of the Earl of Dalhousie, near Haddington; and
there is or was, a glass cap at Muncaster castle, given by
Henry VI. to Sir John Pennington, which, from the general
opinion of the King's sanctity, and that he entailed with
the gift a blessing on the family, was called "the Luck of
Muncaster."</p>

the goblet at Eden Hall, sufficiently showing the sacred
uses to which it was originally appropriated. Philip, Duke
of Wharton, alludes to it in his ballad, called&mdash;</p>

<p>J. H. Wiffen wrote a short poem upon the "Luck of
Eden Hall," and the German poet, Upland, has a ballad
upon the same subject.</p>

<p>The Musgraves are a family of great antiquity and
reputation. They came to England with the Conqueror,
and settled first in Musgrave, in Westmoreland; then at
Hartley Castle, in the same county; and, finally, at their
present residence at Eden Hall. Sir Philip Musgrave, who
was commander-in-chief of the king's troops for Cumberland
and Westmoreland, in the Parliamentary war, just walks
across the stage in Scott's legend of Montrose; but, by
mistake the novelist calls him Sir Miles.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-5">I</span>N the early part of the summer of 1807, a very handsome
young lady, apparently about twenty-two, came to the
village of Hawes, and took lodgings there. She positively
refused to tell either her name or the place of her residence.
Her manners were highly accomplished, though her behaviour
sometimes assumed a degree of wildness and
incoherence, which raised doubts as to the state of her
mind. Her dress was rather rich than splendid; and white
was her customary attire. A broad pink ribbon was always
tied round her waist, with two ends behind, reaching to her
feet. It was observed that she took particular pleasure in
seeing these ribbons flutter in the wind, as she rambled
over the adjoining fells. Curiosity, that busy personage in
most places, and particularly so in the village of Hawes
was eager to trace the history of the mysterious visitor, but
in vain. The most distant allusion to the subject always
produced silence.</p>

<p>Some supposed that she was a young lady who had been
crossed in love, and had fled hither to brood over her disappointment
in solitude; indeed her conduct rather sanctioned
such an opinion, for she kept no company. When she saw
any one, it was to administer relief or to enquire after their
wants.</p>

<p>Others thought she might be some young widow, who
had chosen to linger out her existence in obscurity in such
a secluded spot as that. This opinion did not want support
for she was constant in her visits to all the widows in the
village, beside lodging with one.</p>

<p>Others again thought she was betrothed to some military
officer, and chose to escape the importunities of other lovers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
by hiding herself here till peace should restore her future
husband to her arms.</p>

<p>Such were a few of the many surmises which at that
time constituted the tea-table gossip at Hawes. Though
each party felt confident that its own opinion was right, it
remained only vague conjecture; for the young lady herself
never dropped a single hint which could in the least turn
the scale of imagination to the side of certainty.</p>

<p>One evening, having taken her accustomed ramble, she
did not return; and the widow with whom she lodged
became extremely impatient and uneasy. Inquiries were
made in all directions, but no one had seen her. Several
young men volunteered to search her usual haunts, but
nothing could be found.</p>

<p>For several weeks, and even months, the sudden disappearance
of the fair stranger continued to occupy the
principal attention of the village. Nor will this appear
surprising, when you recollect that only seldom anything
occurs in a place like that of a romantic nature; yet the
hearts of the inhabitants are as open to the sympathies of
humanity in that place as in others.</p>

<p>At last it was remembered that a carriage, with the blinds
up, had called to water the horses at Mr. Clark's on that
evening; and had driven forward without any one alighting.
At the time it was considered to be an empty carriage; but
when the fair stranger was found to have disappeared so
mysteriously the same evening, it was concluded that she
had been carried off by her friends in this very carriage.</p>

<p>Without attempting to explain how this was, she was
never heard of after that day.</p>

<p>The picture I would draw from this story is simply this:&mdash;One
of her usual walks was up the glen to Hardra waterfall.
Every day, when the weather would permit, did she
traverse this glen. After viewing the immense column of
water which there is precipitated over the projecting rock<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
into the unfathomable cistern at its foot, she would ascend
the steep acclivity which leads to the top of the rock.
Upon a natural rude column of stone on the left hand side,
which appears to have been torn from the parent rock
during some convulsion of nature, would she stand for
hours, her long pink ribbons fluttering in the mountain
breeze. I know of no finer subject than this for a picture.
The broken and overhanging rocks&mdash;the loose fragments at
their feet&mdash;the cascade itself, the finest in the country&mdash;the
brook fretting and foaming down the rugged glen&mdash;the
stunted trees, and matted foliage, which protrude from the
fissures of this natural wall&mdash;the huge erect pillar of stone,
which rears its detached mass above the adjoining rock&mdash;and
one of the loveliest females I ever saw, attired in
flowing white drapery, which, with the ribbons, fluttered
and played upon the wind&mdash;could you find a subject equal
to this for interest, one equal to it for sublimity and beauty?</p>

<span class="i0">And a few natural graves." To Jane, his wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus spake the homely priest of Ennerdale.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a July evening; and he sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the long stone-seat beneath the eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of his old cottage,&mdash;as it chanced, that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Employ'd in winter's work. Upon the stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His wife sate near him, teasing matted wool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While, from the twin cards tooth'd with glittering wire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He fed the spindle of his youngest child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who turned her large round wheel in the open air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With back and forward steps. Towards the field<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which the parish chapel stood alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Girt round with a bare ring of mossy wall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While half an hour went by, the priest had sent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many a long look of wonder: and at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Risen from his seat, beside the snow-white ridge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of carded wool which the old man had piled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He laid his implements with gentle care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each in the other lock'd; and, down the path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That from his cottage to the churchyard led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He took his way, impatient to accost<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stranger, whom he saw still lingering there.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His expectations to the fickle winds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perilous waters&mdash;with the mariners<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fellow-mariner&mdash;and so had fared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through twenty seasons; but he had been rear'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the mountains, and he in his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was half a shepherd on the stormy seas.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Oft in the piping shrouds had Leonard heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tones of waterfalls and inland sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of caves and trees:&mdash;and, when the regular wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the tropics fill'd the steady sail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And blew with the same breath through days and weeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lengthening invisibly its weary line<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Along the cloudless main, he, in those hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tiresome indolence, would often hang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Over the vessel's side, and gaze and gaze;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, while the broad green wave and sparkling foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flash'd round him images and hues that wrought<br /></span>

<span class="i0">On verdant hills&mdash;with dwellings among trees,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In all his hardships, since that happy time<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tidings of one whom he so dearly loved,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Towards the churchyard he had turn'd aside;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">His family were laid, he thence might learn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If still his brother lived, or to the file<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another grave was added.&mdash;He had found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another grave, near which a full half-hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had remain'd; but, as he gazed, there grew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such a confusion in his memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he began to doubt; and he had hopes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he had seen this heap of turf before&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That it was not another grave, but one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had forgotten. He had lost his path,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As up the vale, that afternoon, he walk'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through fields which once had been well known to him:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And O what joy the recollection now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sent to his heart! He lifted up his eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, looking round, imagined that he saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange alteration wrought on every side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among the woods and fields, and that the rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everlasting hills themselves were changed.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">By this the priest, who down the field had come<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unseen by Leonard, at the churchyard gate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stopp'd short,&mdash;and thence, at leisure, limb by limb<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Tears down his cheek, or solitary smiles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into his face, until the setting sun<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-4">O</span>N the death of Emma's father, she found herself, with
a widowed mother, deprived, at one stroke, of nearly
all the comforts, and the means of procuring them,
which she had enjoyed during her father's lifetime.
A small jointure of thirty pounds a-year was all that
remained to her mother, for her father had died insolvent.</p>

<p>This thirty pounds a-year Emma thought might support
her mother, if she could support herself. Determined to
burden no one for her subsistence, and believing that humble
servitude was, in the eyes of Heaven and of men, more
honourable than a mean and degrading dependence on the
bounty of friends for a precarious supply of our temporary
wants.</p>

<p>Her mother strenuously opposed Emma's resolution of
going to service. She would subject herself to any privations,
rather than her young and lovely daughter would be
reduced to this severe necessity&mdash;she would work for hire&mdash;she
would beg&mdash;she would borrow&mdash;she should almost
steal, rather than Emma should be compelled to labour.
Her mother's entreaties, however, so far from having the
desired effect of preventing her going to service, only confirmed
Emma in her previous resolution. Should she be a
burden to her mother&mdash;to that mother who expressed so
tender a solicitation for her welfare&mdash;who was rapidly
descending the downhill of life&mdash;who had all her days been
accustomed to the elegances of taste? No, no; rather than
take anything from her, she would add a little to her
comforts; and a portion of her yearly wage should be set
apart as a present to her mother.</p>

<p>The affectionate mother, who had never before parted a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
single day with her daughter, saw her set out to her place
of service (a gentleman's family among the lakes, where her
father had been upon terms of intimacy) with an aching
heart. She felt as if she was parting with her for the last
time; and required all the resolution she was mistress of to
tear herself from her dear Emma. "Go," she said, "and
take a mother's fondest, warmest blessing; and if you
should find yourself unable to accomplish your resolution,
or feel any inconvenience, return and share what Heaven
has left us, with an affectionate mother. It is not much,
Heaven knows; but I could doubly enjoy it, were it less, if
I had you to share it." Emma assured her mother, that if
any unforeseen difficulty occurred, she would instantly repair
to her natal home; and cheered her with a promise of constantly
writing. This pacified, but did not console her
mother. She knew too well the independent spirit of
her daughter to hope for her return, except on some awful
emergency.</p>

<p>Time rolled on, and repeated letters, both from Emma
and her mistress, assured the mother that all was well,
and that Emma was healthy and happy. At length Emma
sent the joyful intelligence that she would come over on
Whitsun Sunday morning, and spend the week with her.</p>

<p>Emma arose, with buoyant spirits, packed up a small
bundle of necessaries in a handkerchief, put her wages in
her bosom, and set out to see and cheer her affectionate
parent. The morning was extremely fine, and she amused
herself with the bright and varied prospect, till the road,
descending a steep hill, led her into a richly romantic
valley. A copse of wood overhung the road, a huge rock
formed the fence on that side next the wood, and seemed
like a natural wall. Over the rock fell, in three or four
unequal cascades, the stream of a brook which might be
heard tumbling through the wood to a considerable distance.
Close to the place where the water left the wood, one part<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
of the rock shot up to an immense height, bearing no very
distant resemblance to the ruins of an old castle. From a
fissure in the rock grew the stump of an old oak, whose
branches had apparently been lopped by the wind, except
one, which, bending down almost to the stream, had
escaped its ravages by its humble situation. On a large
stone, in this romantic spot, Emma sat down to rest herself
awhile, and slake her thirst at the stream.</p>

<p>Though Emma's heart did not entertain a thought but of
the joy her mother would feel on receiving the first-fruits
of her first wages, every bosom was not warmed by so
generous an impulse. Sam the cow-lad at Emma's master's
had ascertained that she had that day received her wages,
and was gone to her mother's; and he instantly formed the
resolution to rob the generous girl of the hard earned
pittance. By a nearer route, over the hills, he sought to
meet her in this solitary spot, where there was little
possibility of being surprised in the action. While Emma
was thus meditating on the happiness which she would
soon feel in her mother's arms, Sam came up and commanded
her to deliver up her money; she entreated him to leave
her a little for a present to her mother, but the human fiend
(and human fiends are the worst fiends), refused to leave
her a farthing. He had secured the booty, and Emma was
preparing to pursue her journey, when the horrid thought
entered his head, that unless he added murder to his
robbery, he would be liable to punishment for his crime.
There was not a moment for deliberation; and the lovely,
the young, the innocent Emma fell a corpse at the wretch's
feet. Fear added wings to the speed of the villain, and he
fled, as if from the face of heaven.</p>

<p>The day passed on with the same calm serenity as if
nothing had happened. Noon came to the widow's cottage
but no Emma arrived. As the evening drew on the
mother's unhappiness increased; and she set out to meet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
her daughter, for whose fate she felt most keenly, without
being able to assign any cause. As the sun was sinking,
amid a rich profusion of evening tints, which threw a
dazzling lustre over all the scene, the widow reached the
vale where her murdered daughter slept her last long sleep.
But the pencil alone can finish the picture&mdash;words are of
no utility.</p>

<p>It would be superfluous to say that I would have the
last picture sketched at the moment when the mother first
discovers that it is the lifeless body of her daughter that
lies stained with its own gore, that she is bending over.
Cold must be that heart that would not feel the full force
of such a piece. Poor would the richest landscape you ever
drew appear, when compared with this.</p>

<p>It is strange that those who profess to have hearts so
open to the beauties of nature, should reject the loveliest
object in it. Adam, though placed in the midst of Paradise,
was not content till Eve was added to its other beauties;
nor would I ever draw a picture without such an enlivening
object. Beside, in most of our fine sublime scenes about
the lakes, we lose the principal zest of the piece by having
nothing beautiful to contrast with the rugged. The more
wild and terrible the scene I had to paint, the greater care
would I take to introduce some lovely female form to mark
the contrast; then</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-2">N</span>O one versed in ballad lore&mdash;no reader of old poetry
and romance, can approach Carlisle for the first time
without pleasurable emotion. Carlisle is the border
city&mdash;the city of King Arthur and his knights. It
has been the scene of many a stout siege and bloody feud;
of many a fierce foray, and mournful execution, and of
many a just punishment upon traitors and reivers. It is,
consequently, not to be pictured to the imagination without
unusual interest. Old traditions of events like these have
made it among the most remarkable of the cities of England;
and it would be difficult to name another around which
are clustered so many memories of such various degrees of
attraction to the poetical and historical antiquary. Its
approach from the south, though striking, gives no idea of
its antiquity and former feudalism. It is situated in an
extensive plain, surrounded in the distance by mountains,
amongst which Saddleback, Skiddaw, and Crossfell, are
prominent; and from afar off, with the smoke of its
households hanging over it, does undoubtedly impress the
imagination with ideas of the romantic.</p>

<p>Nearer approach, however, dissipates this illusion. We
lose sight of the valley, being in it, and of the mountains,
in the presence of immediate objects. Tall chimneys rear
their heads in considerable numbers, pouring forth
steam and smoke, and with square buildings and their
numerous windows, prove incontestably that modern
Carlisle is a manufacturing city, and has associations
very different from those of its former history. On
entrance, the contrast between the past and the present
becomes still more vivid. We see that its walls and gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
have disappeared; that its streets are clean, wide and comfortable,
which no ancient streets in England ever were;
and that it has altogether a juvenile, busy, and thriving
appearance, giving few signs (to the eye at least) that it has
been in existence above a century. It is true that two
venerable relics, its castle and its cathedral, remain to attest
its bygone grandeur and glory; but these are not immediately
visible, and have to be sought out by the enquiring
stranger; whilst all around him is modern and prosaic; and
a mere reduplication of the same characteristics of English
life and manners that he must have seen in a hundred other
places.</p>

<p>Still, however, it is "merry Carlisle," and "bonnie
Carlisle," although, like all other mundane things, it has
been changed by time; and is quite as much King Arthur's
city as England is King Arthur's England; and brimfull of
associations which the traveller will be at no loss to recall,
of the crime and sorrow&mdash;the "fierce wars and faithful loves"
of our ancestors, from the year 800 downwards to 1745.
Not that Carlisle is only a thousand years old. It has a
much earlier origin than the year 800, having been founded
by the Romans. By them it was called Luguballium, or
Luguvallum, signifying the tower or station by the wall,
and was so named from its contiguity to the wall of Severus.
The Saxons, disliking this long and awkward name,
abbreviated it into Luel; and afterwards in speaking of it,
called it Caer-luel, or the city of Luel; from whence comes
its present designation of Carlisle. It is supposed to have
been during the Saxon period, if not the chief city, the
frequent residence of that great mythic personage, King
Arthur, where he</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i1">With fifty good and able<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knights that resorted unto him<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
<span class="i2">And were of his round table:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did hold his jousts and tournaments,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whereto were many pressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wherein some knights did far excel<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eke surmount the rest.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among these knights, Sir Lancelot du Lake, Sir Bevis, and
Sir Gawaine are the most conspicuous in tradition. One of
the most celebrated of our most ancient ballads relates to
the latter, and to his marriage with the mis-shapen lady
that afterwards became so fair. The story is a very
beautiful one; and was the model upon which Chaucer
founded his Wife of Bath's Tale. It is worth repeating, for
the sake of those to whom the uncouth rhymes of ancient
days are not familiar; but though it is likely enough that
the number of these is but few, it is too interesting, as
connected with Carlisle, to be left unmentioned in a chapter
expressly devoted to the poetical antiquities of the place.</p>

<p>King Arthur sets off in a great rage. The opprobrious term,
which galled him the more because it was true, fired his
blood, and he challenged the "grimme bar&ograve;ne" to mortal
combat.</p>

<p>Sir Gawaine, who seems to have been of a stature as
gigantic as the famous Sir Hugh C&aelig;sar, who is buried at
Penrith, conquered him by enchantment: his sinews lost
their strength, his arms sank powerless at his side; and he
only received the boon of life at the hands of his enemy by
swearing upon his faith as a knight, to return upon New
Year's day, and bring "true word what thing it was that
women most desired."</p>

<span class="i0">What thing it is all women crave,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And what they most desyre.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>King Arthur made due inquiry; but it was not so easy a
matter to discover the secret.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Some told him riches, pompe, or state;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Some rayment fine and brighte;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But still his minde was helde in doubte,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Each tolde a different thinge.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As New Year's day approached, his tribulation increased;
for though he might have told the "grimme bar&ograve;ne" with
much truth many things that women did much desire, he
was not at all sure that his version of what they most desired,
would hit the fancy of the Lord of Tarn-Wadling, who
had set him to expound the riddle. He would not give up,
however, and one day,&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">As ruthfulle he rode over a more,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He saw a ladye sitte<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between an oke, and a greene holl&eacute;ye,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A worse-form'd ladye than she was,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">No man mote ever viewe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This ill-conditioned damsel tells him the secret, however,
upon condition that he will bring her a "fair and courtly
knight to marry her,"&mdash;a condition which, considering all
the circumstances, must have seemed to the good king as
bad as the jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire. The
great secret is, as she expresses it, "that all women will
have their wille, and this is their chief desyre," which
Arthur forthwith tells to the "grimme bar&ograve;ne;" and so
acquits himself as far as he is concerned. The other
trouble, however, still remains, and fills the king's mind
with anxiety. Queen Guinevere, who was outraged as well
as her husband by the opprobrious message of the "grimme
bar&ograve;ne," but who had never thought of the very obvious
solution of the riddle he had been set, comes out to meet
him on his return, and inquires how he has sped. He
details his new tribulation in having promised to procure
a fair knight to marry this ugly, mis-shapen creature.
Comfort is nearer at hand than he thought, and Sir Gawaine,
his own nephew, "his sister's son," bids him "be merrye and
lighte," for he will marry her, however foul and loathsome
she may be. He does so accordingly:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when they were in wed-bed laid,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">And all her necke was snowe.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Agreeably surprised at the change, Sir Gawaine soon learns
to love the lady. She informs him that, by a cruel fate,
she cannot be fair both night and day; and asks him which
he prefers. He hints that the night would be most pleasant;
to which she replies:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">What when gaye ladyes goe with their lordes<br /></span>

<p>The spell is broken. She tells him her history; and that
henceforth she shall be fair both night and day.</p>

<p>Another ballad, equally celebrated, though not so beautiful,
also relates to King Arthur's residence at Carlisle, and
to the truth of the imputation cast upon Queen Guinevere
by the "grimme bar&ograve;ne" of the last story. It is entitled
"The Boy and the Mantle," commencing somewhat uncouthly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In the third day of May,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To Carleile did come<br /></span>

<p>This "child" brings that wondrous mantle which no lady
who is not chaste can wear; and it is tried upon all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
dames of the court. When Queen Guinevere put it on, it
was suddenly rent from the top to the bottom, and turned
in succession all manner of colours, and is told as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>The lady of Sir Kay, another of King Arthur's knights,
tries it on with no better success; and the ballad thus
corroborates the old traditions reported by the earliest
historians, that the court of the British King was anything
but a pure one, "and that Queen Guinevere was noted for
breach of faith to her husband," especially with her
husband's friend, Sir Lancelot du Lake, the hero himself of
many a goodly ballad; and of some passages in the Morte
Arthur.</p>

<p>Mixing the real with the fabulous history of Carlisle, and
taking both in chronological order, we must leave these
ancient ballads to relate that, during the period of the
British Kings, Carlisle suffered from the incursions of the
Scots and Picts, by whom it was ultimately reduced to
ruins; it was rebuilt by Egfrid, King of Northumberland,
who surrounded and fortified it with a wall; founded a
monastery and a college of secular priests. It was once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
more destroyed by the Danes, about the year 900, who
threw down the walls, burned its houses, chiefly built of
wood, and killed every person in it, man, woman, and child.
It remained in ruins, it is believed, for nearly 200 years.
On the return of William Rufus from Alnwick, after
concluding a peace with the turbulent Scotch, he passed
over the remains of this once celebrated city, and observing
that it must have been a place of great strength, and could
be made so again, he resolved to rebuild it for the protection
of the border. He did so: and Carlisle became of more
importance than it had ever been before. Its castle was
built and garrisoned; and every means taken to render it a
stronghold both for offensive and defensive warfare. Henry
the First completed what Rufus had so well begun, erected
Carlisle into an Episcopal see in the year 1132, making
Athelwold, his confessor, the first bishop.</p>

<p>In Evans's Collection of Old Ballads is one relating to a
bishop of Carlisle at this early period. It is entitled
"Bishop Thurston and the King of Scots," and contains some
beautiful passages which render it worthy of all the publicity
that can be given to it; especially as the whole composition
inculcates sentiments of abhorrence for warfare, rare at the
time it was penned, but now, happily, in the ascendant.
Soon after King Stephen's departure for Normandy, <span class="smcap-all">A.D.</span> 1137,
the King of Scotland entered England in a hostile manner.
Stephen's Government was not in a position to resist an invasion
at that time; and the miseries of war were averted by
the interposition of the venerable Bishop Thurston, who
prevailed upon the Scotch King to meet him at Roxburgh,
and used such arguments as induced him to return to his
own country in peace. They are said to have been arguments
of Christian charity, and not the arguments of policy
and the sword, which bishops as well as barons could use

of the ballad.</p>

<p>From the time of Henry I. the place began to prosper,
though it appears from Stowe that, in 1829, a great portion
of it was burned down. In the year 1300, King Edward I.
summoned his barons and knights to meet him here on the
feast-day of St. John the Baptist, to prepare for the
invasion of Scotland; which was afterwards commenced by
the siege of Carlaverock castle. The same monarch also
summoned a Parliament to meet here in the year 1307, the
last parliament of his reign. A complete list of the members
who attended is to be found in Stowe's <cite>Annals</cite>, including, says
the historian, "eighty-seven earls and barons, twenty bishops,
sixty-one abbots, and eight priors, besides many deacons,
archdeacons and other inferior clerks. The subject of their
deliberations was the Scottish war, and the sore annoyance
given by Robert Bruce. The King remained here from
January, when the Parliament was summoned, during all
the winter and summer, disposing of many things concerning
Scotland at his pleasure," but vexing himself to death
at his inability, from sickness and other causes, to march
against Robert Bruce. He had some revenge, however, for
a party of his men "capturing one Thomas, that was a
knight, and one Alexander, that was a priest and dean of
Glasgow," who had been sent by Robert Bruce to "allure
away the English people by gentle persuasion;" he had
them summarily hanged, drawn, and quartered, and placed
their heads upon the gates of Carlisle&mdash;those gates where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
the heads of so many Scotchmen were afterwards to grin in
ghastly horror until 1745.</p>

<p>Among the poetical and historical associations connected
with Carlisle, the famous battle of Otterbourne, and the
still more famous ballad which celebrates it, must not be
omitted. In the twelfth year of Richard II., <span class="smcap-all">A.D.</span> 1388,
the Scotch made a great raid over the border, and ravaged
the whole country about Carlisle, driving away large
quantities of cattle, and taking no less than 300 men
prisoners. Another division of them extended their
ravages into the counties of Northumberland and Durham;
and grew so insolent as to render a vigorous effort
necessary to crush them, on the part of the English.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The version of the ballad, as given by Percy, is the only
one of the many versions extant which makes allusion to
the party that ravaged Carlisle. The main interest is
centred around Newcastle, and on the doings of the other
division of the Scotch. There is, however, another ballad
of which Carlisle is more exclusively the theme. It is
somewhat less known to the English reader, not being found
in Percy's <cite>Reliques</cite>; and describes a scene which was very
common to the border for a long period. Mr. Gilbert has
illustrated it by a picturesque sketch. The principal
portions of this ballad, sufficient to tell the story, are here
transcribed. In the year 1596, William Armstrong, of
Kinmont, better known as Kinmont Willie, a noted reiver,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
or border trooper, and stealer of Englishmen's cattle, was
taken prisoner by Lord Scrope, the Warden of the Western
Marches, and safely lodged in Carlisle Castle. A truce
existed at the time between Lord Scrope and the Lord of
Buccleugh, who severally watched over the interests of the
English and Scottish sides of the border; and the Lord of
Buccleugh, incensed that the truce had been broken by the
capture of Willie, demanded that he should be set at liberty.
Lord Scrope refused; and the Lord of Buccleugh, with a
small body of two hundred men, performed the daring feat
of surprising the castle of Carlisle, and rescuing his countryman.
The "fause Sakelde," alluded to in the ballad, was
the then possessor of Corby castle, and sheriff of Cumberland&mdash;the
chief of the powerful family of the Salkeldes; and
"Hairibee" was the slang phrase for the place of execution
at Carlisle.</p>

<p>This was a daring exploit, and has been gallantly sung.
The words seem to come out of the mouth of one of the very
moss troopers who had acted a part in the achievement, and
the whole composition is rough but finely flavoured; and
strongly dramatic. Queen Elizabeth, when she heard of it,
was highly indignant, and "stormed not a little." Two
years afterwards, the "bold Buccleugh" was in England,
and Elizabeth was anxious to see so doughty a chieftain.
He was presented accordingly, and Elizabeth, in a rough
and peremptory manner, demanded of him how he had
dared to undertake an enterprise so desperate and presumptuous!</p>

<p>"What is it," replied the undaunted Scot, "that a man
dare not do?"</p>

<p>Elizabeth, struck with his boldness, turned to a lord in
waiting, and said, "with ten thousand men such as this, our
brother of Scotland might shake the firmest throne in
Europe."</p>

<p>There is another ballad relating to the same Lord Scrope,
and the execution of a noted reiver, named "Hughie the
Gr&aelig;me," who had made woeful havoc in his time among
the farmsteads of the Marches, and the cattle of "merry
England." Hughie did not escape Hairibee. The actual
offence for which he suffered was his stealing the Bishop of
Carlisle's mare. The following is the ballad:&mdash;</p>

<p>There are two or more versions of the foregoing: one in
Ritson's Collection; and one communicated by Burns to
Johnson's Museum. The ballad of Hobbie Noble relates
to a hero of the same stamp, who suffered about the same
period, at the same place, for a similar love for English oxen
and sheep. Hobbie was an Englishman; who, finding less
difference in the laws of "mine and thine" on the Scotch
side of the border, and more sympathy with such loose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
notions of property as he possessed, established himself
among the Scotch, and helped them to ravage the country
to Carlisle southward, whenever opportunity offered. The
Scotch, however, proved false to him. The Armstrongs,
amongst whom he was residing, were bribed by the English
to decoy him over the border upon pretence of a raid or
foray; where he was delivered up to a party from Carlisle
castle, that had long been on the look-out for him. By
these he was taken to Carlisle, and hanged on Hairibee in
less than twenty-four hours afterwards.</p>

<p>Referring the reader to Percy's <cite>Reliques</cite> for "Adam
Bell, Clym of the Clough, and William of Cloudesley," a
long and interesting ballad of this period, or somewhat
earlier, we conclude this portion of the poetical antiquities
of Carlisle by a very beautiful and touching ballad, "the
lament of the border widow." It is founded upon the story
of Cockburn of Henderland, a noted disturber of the
English districts; who did not, however, suffer at Carlisle,
though he had ravaged its neighbourhood; nor at the hands
of the English, whose laws he had violated. James the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
Fifth, scandalized at the excesses of these border reivers,
made an excursion into their country in 1529, and executed
summary justice upon several of the most turbulent and
lawless of them, including the famous Johnnie Armstrong,
Adam Scot of Tushielaw, and Cockburn of Henderland.</p>

<p>The latter was hanged, by the King's order, over the gate
of his own keep, or tower, while his lady fled to the banks
of a mountain-stream, called the Henderland burn, and sat
down at the foot of a foaming cataract, to drown, amid the
sound of the roaring waters, the noise of the drums that
announced the close of her husband's existence. The place
where she sat is still shown to the stranger. The author of
the ballad is unknown. It was taken down from recitation
in the Ettrick forest, and is as affecting a ballad as any in
the language, abounding with touches of genuine pathos,
and most lovely simplicity of sorrow. Exquisite is the
whole composition; and many of the passages are worthy
of the greatest of poets.</p>

<p>The devoted wife was buried with her husband. In a
deserted burial place, which once surrounded the keep of
Henderland, the monument was lately, and perhaps is still,
to be seen. It is a large stone, broken into three parts,
but some armorial bearings are traceable, and the following
inscription&mdash;legible though much defaced, "<span class="smcap">Here lyes
Perys of Cokburne and his wyfe, Marjory</span>."</p>

<p>During the civil wars with the "Roses," Carlisle suffered
severely; sometimes from the one party and sometimes
from the other&mdash;a calamity which it shared, however, with
all the other principal towns of the kingdom. In the
formidable rising against Henry the Eighth, led originally
by Sir Robert Aske, and known as the Pilgrimage of Grace,
the city was besieged by 8000 men. They were under the
command of Nicholas Musgrave, Thomas Gilley, and others,
who appeared as leaders of the movement, after it had been
abandoned by Aske and its other originators. The citizens,
knowing that the Duke of Norfolk was marching to their
relief, sallied out upon their besiegers, and put them to
flight. Seventy of the leaders were captured by the Duke;
but Musgrave, the prime mover, escaped. The others were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
hanged and beheaded, and their heads placed upon the gates
of the city. This happened in the year 1537.</p>

<p>Little more than a century afterwards, Carlisle suffered a
severer siege by the Scotch and Parliamentary forces, under
General Lesley. It was defended for the Royalists by Sir
Thomas Glenham; and surrendered on the 28th of June,
1645, after having held out for more than six months. During
the siege, the distress of the garrison and the inhabitants
was so severe, that the flesh of horses, dogs, rats, and other
vermin was eaten. Bread was exhausted and hemp-seed
substituted; which in its turn became so dear as to be unpurchasable
by all except the most wealthy. A coinage of
silver pieces, of three shillings value, was instituted in the
castle during the siege, from the plate of the inhabitants,
which was sent in for the purpose. The diary of Isaac
Tullie, a resident in the city during the siege, preserved
among the Harleian MSS. in the British Museum, states
that "the citizens were so shrunk from starvation, that
they could not choose but laugh at one another, to see their
clothes hang upon them as upon men on gibbets, for one
might put one's head and fists between the doublets and
shirts of many of them."</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-3">T</span>he old road between Keswick and Penrith passes over
a rough hill, called Castle Rigg, which the new road
now avoids. In a field adjoining this road, on the
right hand side going to Penrith, just on the crown
of the hill, and at the distance of a mile and a-half east
by north from Keswick, are the remains of a Druidical
Temple, popularly named the Druids' Stones.</p>

<p>These interesting memorials of the primeval age of
Britain consist of forty-eight rude, unhewn blocks of granite,
thirty-eight of which are disposed in an oval figure, of
which the diameter is thirty-four yards from north to south,
and nearly thirty from east to west: the remaining ten
stones form an oblong square on the eastern side of the oval
area. The latter enclosure, which is seven yards by three,
is supposed to have been the sacred place, exclusively
appropriated to the Druidical order, where the priests
assembled to perform their mystical rites, and to determine
on matters of government and judicature. The largest of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
the stones is upwards of seven feet in height, and may
weigh about eight tons, but the greater number measure
only three or four feet in height; they mostly stand in an
erect position.</p>

<p>The situation of this ancient place for superstitious
worship has been skilfully chosen, when considered with
reference to the idolatrous superstitions of the Druids; the
objects of which were to subdue the mind with appalling
images, and to extort obedience through the agency of terror.
It is seated in the neighbourhood of Skiddaw, Blencathara,
and Helvellyn, and some of the highest mountains of
Cumberland, whose clouded summits impended over the
sacrificial altar, casting obscure shadows through its precincts.
Hither the trembling worshippers repaired, to hear and to
acknowledge the teachings and denunciations of their
potent masters. In the eyes of the barbarian Britons, alike
ignorant, credulous, and superstitious, the place would
appear to be the very sanctuary of Omnipotence, and the
Druid ministers themselves an impersonation of their gods.
Wind and cloud, storm and tempest, wrought powerfully in
the abstruse mysteries and terrific incantations constituting
the Druidical worship; and the mind was prostrated, with
terrific awe, at the shrine where natural sublimity combined
with human cunning to thrill its scarcely awakened faculties.
Here, at midnight, every Druid, summoned by the terrible
horn, never sounded but upon high occasions, and descending
from his mountain or secret cave, might assemble, without
intrusion from one sacrilegious footstep, and celebrate a
festival.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By rites of such strange potency,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As, done in open day, would dim the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though 'throned in noontide brightness."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The tourist will tread this once hallowed circle, where
the Druids offered their adorations to Deity, and sat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
judgment on their fellow-men, with a mixture of awe and
veneration, so well expressed by the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Skirted with unhewn stone, it awes my soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if the very Genius of the place<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stalked through this drear domain."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In spite of the ravages of time, assisted by the destructive
hand of man, many Druidical monuments still remain
amongst the seclusions of the lakes and mountains of
Cumberland and Westmoreland, and many are the strange
tales connected with them. For the interest of our readers,
we select the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>In times long gone by, when these mountains reared
their naked heads to the clouds&mdash;when their sides were
clothed with oak, and their feet were wet with morasses&mdash;when
the wild cow and the wolf contested the mastership
of the unclaimed property&mdash;when human feet had never
trod these hills or vales&mdash;a mighty warrior left his companions
in the south and journeyed hitherward. His
followers, as they traversed the forests towards the north,
met with a beautiful river, at the foot of a gentle hill, well
clothed with wood. The warrior said to his companions,
let us here construct our tents. Here is wood for shelter
and fire; and this river and these mountains will supply us
with food.</p>

<p>Then they fixed poles in the ground, and fastened them
together with wicker-work of branches, and covered them
with the green sod from the ground. And the warrior said,
the old oak trees around our dwellings will shelter us from
the storm in winter, and shade us from the sun in summer.
Thus they continued to pass the time in hunting the wild
deer among the hills, and in fishing in the adjoining river;
and as they were not disturbed by wars, they rapidly increased
in strength and numbers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Their ancient priests or Druids retired farther north,
because their solemn rites required the greatest privacy;
and the mistletoe, their sacred emblem, abounded more
among the northern forests. Besides, stones to construct
their temples of were more easily procured among these
hills; and being far from the haunts of men, they could
indulge in the gloomy contemplation of the vindictive
character of the Deity&mdash;for they knew him only as a Being
capable of revenging every insult offered to His name.</p>

<p>When their town was become very populous, there lived
in it a youth of superior strength and agility, who was
remarked for being particularly expert with the bow, and
so swift that few could outstrip him in the race. At feats
of strength or skill, he was ever foremost: and, in attacking
the wolf, or the wild cow, few possessed so daring a soul.
It is an old maxim, with few exceptions, that love is the
companion of bravery&mdash;and Mudor loved the gentle Ella.
They had retired, at an early age, to a grove farther up the
river, where stood the image of their God Mogan, which
had been purchased of some Phenician merchants, along
with some iron hatchets, in exchange for the skins of beasts,
slain in the chase. Before this rude representation of the
Deity they mutually pledged their vows; and to render
those pledges more binding, they each stained a blue sun on
their breasts, as a memorial that their faith should be as
durable as the light of that luminary. No one felt so proud
on hearing the praise of Mudor as Ella did&mdash;no one hailed
his return from the chase, loaded with spoils, with the
warmth of Ella&mdash;nor did any one so much admire the
elegance of the blue symbols of his prowess and his faith,
which were painted on his skin, as did the faithful Ella.
Reared in two adjoining cabins, their infant sports had been
together. For her he had plunged into the morass to
procure the richest and sweetest water-lilies&mdash;he had climbed
the loftiest oak to gain the cushat eggs&mdash;and the scarf of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
squirrel skins which screened her from the cold, was the
produce of his most early adventures in the chase. Thus
circumstanced, their hearts were knit together by those ties
which bind the savage as well as the civilized; for the heart
of the naked Indian who treads the burning sands of the
desert is as warm to the tender impressions of love as the
prince who stretches his limbs on a silken couch, or reposes
on a bed of down.</p>

<p>These faithful lovers dreamt of no unkindly fate interfering,
when a fever broke out in the town, and swept
away a number of its inhabitants. Application was made
to the priest of Mogan to avert the awful visitation by
prayer; but he returned for answer, that the wickedness of
the people had offended the Great Invisible, and the fever
was sent as a just punishment. The Druids, therefore, who
resided in the neighbourhood, made a pilgrimage to one of
their largest temples, situated among the mountains, in the
midst of a vast forest. The Arch-Druid, having gathered
the mistletoe, just as the rising sun licked the dew from its
berries, and performed a number of other rites, to obtain
answer from the Great Spirit, informed them that Heaven
would not be appeased unless a young virgin was immolated
as a sacrifice for the sins of the inhabitants. When this
intelligence was announced, the utmost dismay seized on
every heart. Parents trembled for their daughters, and the
daughters trembled for themselves; for no one knew on
whom the lot would fall.</p>

<p>The Druids of the neighbouring groves assembled together,
and cast lots, according to their established usage. The lot
fell on Ella! Sad was the heart of Mudor when he heard
this; and vainly did he entreat that some other victim
might be selected in her stead. It was the irrevocable
decree of heaven, and the priests had not the power to alter
it. No one felt the sentence less severely than Ella did.
She resigned herself to the will of the Deity; and would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
not render unavailable the sacrifice by any vain and foolish
complaints. Still the affection she felt for Mudor would
steal across her mind, and a momentary wish that she
might have lived to fulfil her vows would interrupt her
devotional complacency.</p>

<p>The morning arrived when Ella was to be conveyed far into
the deserts, among the northern mountains, to the gloomy
dell, where Heaven would alone be appeased. Mudor, at a
humble distance, followed the procession of the Druids, and
separating himself from the crowd which usually assembled
to witness those awful rites of the Druid priests, appeared
like one who had no conception of what was passing before
him. They at length arrived at the place of sacrifice, which
was a gloomy dell, in the midst of a forest, near the banks
of a river, surrounded by magnificent scenery. This dell
was a curious cavity in the rock, of considerable extent,
and rendered almost dark by the overhanging branches of
the ancient oaks which grew above it. A small circular
area, surrounded with large upright stones, was the place of
sacrifice. The priests assembled to perform their horrid
rites; while the gaping crowd hung in the fissures of the
rock on each side, or sat on the branches of the trees, waiting
the celebration of the awful ceremony. The bards,
with their heads crowned with oak, advanced to the north
side of the circle; and after paying obedience to the sun,
they chanted the following hymn:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Being great, who reign'st alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Veiled in clouds, unseen, unknown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Centre of the vast profound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clouds of darkness close thee round.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy nod makes storms and tempests rise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy breath makes thunder shake the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy frown turns noon-day into night,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And makes the sun withdraw his light.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beneath thy anger we expire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The victims of thy vengeful ire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Destruction rules at thy command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ruin blackens all the land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A small cabin of basket-work was erected near the
western side of the circle, in the lowest part of the dell,
with a door opening towards the Druidical circle. In this
the youthful Ella was to be immolated. She was brought
into the circle; a garland of oak leaves was bound round
her neck, a chaplet of wild flowers placed on her head, and
a piece of mistletoe in her hand. Thus adorned she was led
to the centre of the circle, and supported there by two aged
priests, while the bards chanted the following invocation to
the sun:&mdash;</p>

<p class="char">FIRST BARD.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"See, thy destined victim see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bright, and chaste, and pure as thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let this sinless virgin please thee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sinful man could ne'er appease thee."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="char">SECOND BARD.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Round her brows the wild flowers see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Emblems of thy purity&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Touch'd by mortal's fingers never;&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Round her breast the oak survey,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which like thee can ne'er decay&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Innocence endures for ever."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="char">THIRD BARD.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Spirit! who no birth has known,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Springing from thyself alone,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lives and blooms the child of air."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="char">FOURTH BARD.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou dost thy mystic circle trace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Along the vaulted blue profound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, emblematic of thy race,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="char">ALL THE BARDS.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Shine upon us, mighty God&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Raise this drooping world of ours&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Send from thy divine abode,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cheering sun and fruitful showers."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The lovely Ella was then enclosed in the wicker cabin: a
quantity of dry withered leaves, and small dry branches,
were laid all round the cabin ready to set fire to. Every one
of the crowd was obliged to furnish at least one stick
towards producing a fire to consume the victim. But
Mudor stood at a distance, determined rather to incur the
vengeance of the Invisible Spirit than add one particle to the
destruction of his adorable Ella. The Arch-Druid took two
pieces of wood, and exposing them to the sun, rubbed them
together, while all the bards chanted the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sun descend in a ray of light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrapp'd in thy power and clad in thy might;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come in a red and a fiery stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come in a bright and glowing beam;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come in thy flaming chariot down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burn the wood in a flame of thy own."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The friction of the two pieces of wood had the desired
effect&mdash;they took fire. The sticks and leaves round the
cabin which contained the ill-fated Ella were instantly in a
blaze. As the flames arose the bards chanted, with loud
voices, the following verses:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mighty Sovereign of the skies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Accept this virgin sacrifice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her spotless soul atone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wicked actions not her own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As to death her spirit stoops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As she faints and as she droops,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay aside thy fiery crown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spare, O spare, her native town!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was good, and she was kind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she possess'd a heavenly mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wicked man could ne'er atone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his sins and crimes alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A purer victim must be found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wash the stain away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The bards stopped short, and raised their hands with
astonishment&mdash;the crowd shrieked out with fear&mdash;and all
the rites were suspended; for at that moment a flood of
water burst out from the fissures of the rock on every side,
and came rolling down the dell like a river. The wicket
hurdle in which Ella was confined was instantly surrounded
by the flood&mdash;the fire was quenched, and she came out unhurt.
It is said that a voice was heard by the Arch-Druid
of solemn import, intimating that human victims were not
acceptable to the Deity&mdash;that a greater sacrifice was about
to be offered&mdash;and that the reign of Druidism was at an end.
The Arch-Druid, turning his face towards the sun for a
moment, and then to the other priests, remarked that some
mighty change was surely about to take place among them;
for this was a miracle they could have no conception of.</p>

<p>The assembly dispersed in consternation; and the devoted
Ella was happily restored to the arms of the overjoyed Mudor,
with whom she lived to a good old age; and the rock has
occasionally poured forth its stream ever since.</p>

<span class="smaller">OR, THE UNFORTUNATE TOURIST.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.png" width="21" height="70" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-5">I</span>N making an ascent of Helvellyn, some tourists are bold
enough to traverse the giddy and dangerous heights of
Striding Edge: "but this road," says the Bard of the
Lakes, "ought not to be taken by any one with weak
nerves, as the top in many places scarcely affords room to
plant the foot, and is beset with awful precipices on either
side." The path on one part of the pass is certainly not
more than two yards broad, and a tremendous precipice
descending on each side makes it truly appalling and
perilous.</p>

<p>Mr. Baines, who, with a companion, ascended Helvellyn
by this pass some years ago, thus describes it:&mdash;"The ridge
we were upon&mdash;Striding Edge&mdash;was the shorter but more
rugged path; and, in spite of the warnings of our boatman,
we chose it, being incited by curiosity, and perhaps quite as
much by the motive which actuates most men in fighting
duels&mdash;a fear lest our courage should be called in question
if we declined the danger. We therefore addressed ourselves
to the passage of Striding Edge; but if we had seen the
most dangerous part before we came to it, we should have
been content to take the safer though more cowardly branch
of the alternative offered to us. As we ascended, the hill
became more steep and rugged, till at length the ridge
presented nothing but rocks, the narrow edges of which lay
upwards in the direction of the sky. Their sides became
steeper and steeper, and it was with difficulty that we crept
along paths not wider than a goat-track, to avoid clambering
among the crags which formed the very ridge of the hill.
At length it became impossible to find footing on the side,
and we betook ourselves of necessity to the ridge itself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
We now came in view of the most formidable part of
Striding Edge, and found that it rather deserved to be compared
to a narrow wall, several hundred feet in height,
connecting the hill which we had been ascending with the
head of the mountain, than to the steep roof of a house.
It appeared to us to be absolutely precipitous on each side,
and the top of the rocky wall was not more than from one
to two yards wide, whilst in some places we could not see,
before we came to it, as much ground as would serve to
plant a foot upon&mdash;the rocks presenting their sharp and
rugged edges upwards, like slates or tiles standing on end.
If we had had a guide, all this would have been much less
terrific, because he would have led the way, and shown us
where to place every footstep. The possibility that we
might, after all, have taken a wrong direction, or that in
some part of the pass we should find ourselves in a situation
where we could neither advance nor retreat, gave us considerable
alarm. Neither of us, however, expressed our
fears at the time; and I felt myself bound to keep up both
my own spirits and George's, as the blame would have been
chiefly mine if any accident had happened. I therefore
talked loudly and confidently as we scrambled along, keeping
all my eyes about me, and giving him such instructions as
his want of experience in climbing rendered necessary.
He said little or nothing, and never ventured to cast a look
either at the tarn which lay several hundred feet below us
on one side, or to the equally awful depth on the other;
but, fixing his eyes on the ridge itself as if he were fascinated,
he crept on after me as cautiously and yet as fast as he
could. In this way we crossed the long and dangerous
pass of Striding Edge, till we came to the last ascent of the
mountain."</p>

<p>A melancholy interest attaches to this spot, from the
fate of a young man who perished in its locality some years
ago. It was here that Charles Gough, of Manchester, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
frequent visitor to the Lakes, met with an accident which
caused his death. This unfortunate "young lover of nature,"
confiding in his knowledge of the country, attempted to
cross Helvellyn from Patterdale to Wythburn by the pass
of Striding Edge just described. He set out late one afternoon
early in the spring of 1805, without any guide, and
attended by no companion but his faithful dog. Darkness,
it is supposed, came on before his expectation, and a fall of
snow having partially concealed the path, rendered it still
more dangerous. He wandered from the track, and his body
was found in one of those deep recesses where human foot
rarely treads. It could never be ascertained whether he
was killed by falling from the rocks, or he perished from
hunger. Let us hope that death came with friendly care to
shorten sufferings that might have been yet more awful.</p>

<p>Three months elapsed before his remains were discovered;
when the faithful dog, which was his constant attendant
during frequent solitary rambles amidst the wilds of Cumberland
and Westmorland, was discovered still watching over the
lifeless remains of his master. This striking and affecting
instance of canine faithfulness has been commemorated by
Wordsworth in his beautiful poem entitled <i>Fidelity</i>.</p>

<p>The melancholy circumstances connected with the death
of Charles Gough have also been beautifully depicted by
the powerful pen of Sir Walter Scott, who has paid a
pleasing tribute to the "pilgrim of nature" in some highly
pathetic stanzas, which, by the by, are rendered additionally
interesting from the following anecdote connected with
them:&mdash;"Our two charming poets, Walter Scott and
Campbell, walking together" (says Ryan, in his <cite>Poetry and
the Poets</cite>), "and speaking of this incident, each agreed, in
the spirit of amicable rivalship, to make it the subject of a
poem. Scott, on his way home, composed the following
exquisite lines, which he sent the next day to Campbell,
who returned them with this reply:&mdash;'I confess myself
vanquished: if I were to live a thousand years, I could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
never write anything equal to this, on the same subject;'
and he never attempted it."</p>

<span class="smaller">OR, THE LOVERS OF DERWENTWATER.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.png" width="42" height="70" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-1">A</span>N annual regatta takes place on Derwentwater, when
the several sports of racing, rowing, and wrestling,
are maintained with great spirit.</p>

<p>The following is an excellent description of one of
these occasions in former times:&mdash;"At eight o'clock in the
morning a vast concourse of ladies and gentlemen appeared
on the side of Derwent Lake, where a number of marquees,
extending about 400 yards, were erected for their accommodation.
At twelve, such of the company as were
invited by Mr. Pocklington passed over in boats to the
island which bears his name; and, on their landing, were
saluted by a discharge of his artillery, consisting of five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
four pounders and one nine pounder. This might properly
be called the opening of the regatta; for as soon as the
echo of this discharge had ceased, a signal gun was fired,
and five boats, which lay upon their oars (on that part of
the lake which runs nearest the town of Keswick), instantly
pushed off the shore and began the race. A view from any
of the attendant boats, of which there were several, presented
a scene which beggars all description. The sides of
the hoary mountains were clad with spectators, and the
glassy surface of the lake was variegated with numbers of
pleasure barges, which, trimmed out in all the gayest
colours, and glittering in the rays of the meridian sun, gave
a new appearance to the celebrated beauties of this matchless
vale. The contending boats passed Pocklington's
Island, and rounding St. Herbert's Isle and Rampsholme,
edged down by the outside of Lord's Island, describing, in
the race, almost a perfect circle, and, during the greatest
part of it, in full view of the company.</p>

<p>"About three o'clock preparations were made for a sham
attack on Pocklington's Island. The fleet, consisting of
several barges, armed with small cannon and muskets,
retired out of view, behind Friar Crag, to prepare for action;
previous to which a flag of truce was sent to the governor,
with a summons to surrender on honourable terms. A
defiance was returned; soon after which the fleet was seen
advancing with great spirit before the batteries, and
instantly forming a curved line, a terrible cannonading
began on both sides, accompanied with a dreadful discharge
of musketry. This continued for some time, and being
echoed from hill to hill in an amazing variety of sounds,
filled the ear with whatever could produce astonishment
and awe. All nature seemed to be in an uproar; which
impressed, on the awakened imagination, the most lively
ideas of "the war of elements" and "crush of worlds."
After a severe conflict, the enemies were driven from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
attack in great disorder. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">feu-de-joie</i> was then fired in
the port, and oft repeated by the responsive echoes. The
fleet, after a little delay, formed again; and practising a
variety of beautiful man&oelig;uvres, renewed the attack. Uproar
again sprung up, and the deep-toned echoes of the mountains
again joined in solemn chorus; which was heard at the
distance of ten leagues to leeward, through the easterly
opening of that vast amphitheatre, as far as Appleby.</p>

<p>"The garrison at last capitulated; and the entertainment
of the water being finished, towards the evening the company
rowed to Keswick, to which place, from the water's edge,
a range of lamps was fixed, very happily disposed, and a
number of fire-works played off. An assembly room, which
was built for the purpose, next received the ladies and
gentlemen, and a dance concluded this annual festivity.</p>

<p>"Whilst we sat to regale, the barge put off from shore, to
a station where the finest echoes were to be obtained from
the surrounding mountains. The vessel was provided with
six brass cannon, mounted on swivels; on discharging one
of these pieces the report was echoed from the opposite
rocks, where, by reverberation, it seemed to roll from cliff
to cliff, and return through every cave and valley, till the
decreasing tumult died away upon the ear.</p>

<p>"The instant it ceased the sound of every distant waterfall
was heard; but for an instant only; for the momentary
stillness was interrupted by the returning echo on the hills
behind; where the report was repeated like a peal of
thunder bursting over our heads, continuing for several
seconds, flying from haunt to haunt, till once more the
sound gradually declined. Again the voice of waterfalls
possessed the interval, till to the right the more distant
thunders arose upon some other mountains, and seemed to
take its way up every winding dale and creek; sometimes
behind, on this side, or on that, in wondrous speed running
its dreadful course; when the echo reached the mountains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
within the line and channel of the breeze, it was heard at
once on the right and left at the extremities of the lake.
In this manner was the report of every discharge re-echoed
seven times distinctly."</p>

<p>The following descriptive poem appeared on the occasion
of a regatta at Keswick:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Scarcely had day's bright god begun his course,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And chas'd the misty vapours from the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When, ardent all for pleasure, forth there sprung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bright assemblage of firm, active youths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And virgins blushing like the op'ning bud.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, some there were who sought the sportive scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom frozen age had bow'd with iron hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drawn by the force of curiosity,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or by the workings of parental care,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To watch and guard their blooming daughter's steps.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The neigh'bouring rustics, too, with massy limbs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Inur'd to toil, inur'd to fun and rain;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each led his fav'rite damsel to the sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And talk'd of love, or laugh'd with hearty roar.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And now the vessels all in order range,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To try the fortune of the wat'ry race.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rowers sit; their eyes with ardour glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Attentive watching the appointed sign.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now the gun, the signal for the course.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rends with its iron voice th' o'ervaulting sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And distant rocks, redoubling, echo back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The horrid note. Instantly they start,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, adverse looking, try their utmost skill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Big swells each bulky muscle, strain'd with toil;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er their knit brows the drops of labour pour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst on their faces anxious fear and hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alternate sit depicted. Now they come<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Almost within the grasp of victory:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then, then what rapture fires the victor's mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When with his toil-strained arm he shakes the flag,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouts, applauding, echo all around.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now o'er the azure lake the horrid din<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mimic war resounds; the echoing cliffs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reverberate, in doubled thunder, back<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The awful sounds: fierce peal succeeds to peal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In savage dire confusion. Had the rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which awful frown above this limpid plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Been shaken from their venerable seats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rift by the bolts of Jove, and scattered round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sound more loud, more awful, could be heard!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hero, who, inur'd to bloody war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has stood by Elliot, or by Rodney's side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst million-winged deaths were whistling round,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now feels his heart beat high; strong throbs each pulse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His kindling eyes flash fire: upright he stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when on some dread, memorable day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw the Frenchmen strike, or Spaniards burn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His tender spouse, the dear, the soft reward<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all his toils, astonish'd with the din,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clings to his side, half-pleased and half-afraid;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When softer echoes roll the distant roar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She smiles; but when the air-affrighting guns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With iron clamours shake th' impending rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She trembling presses hard her husband's hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weeps to think the perils he has 'scap'd.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But hark! 'tis silent! see, the fleet retires!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mellow horns now pour victorious sounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst every rock returns the softened strain.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O! now for Shakspeare, or for Milton's muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To paint this mingled tide of harmony!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each cliff, each rock, each mountain, wood, and dale,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Return a varied note; it floats in air;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It mixes, meets, returns; 'tis soft, 'tis loud:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if th' unnumber'd spirits of the rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Held their aërial concerts 'midst the hills;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to his golden harp each join'd his voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To welcome to their bower the 'Fairy Queen.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thus joyous and delightful pass'd the day,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The fair, the innocent Amelia was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pride and flower of all the virgin throng!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her long Dam&oelig;tas loved, she too loved him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But looks alone revealed the mutual flame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For virgin modesty had bound their thoughts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In chains, as yet unbroken. On this day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst she in rapture viewed th' enchanting scene<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Urged by the motion of the limpid wave),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her vessel rolling, headlong plunged her in<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The blue profound! She sank, then rose again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then sank, to rise no more! Dam&oelig;tas, near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld her fall: of life regardless then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He leaped into the flood; with nervous arm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He cut the crystal deep, and plunging down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized, and brought her up again to life.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">My virgin heart hath own'd!' She could no more:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rosy hue again forsook her cheek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The light her eyes, and pallid death awhile<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed to return and re-demand his prey.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What then, Dam&oelig;tas, were the dire alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That rent thy manly bosom? Love, despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grief, and astonishment, exert at once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The utmost of their force to tear thy soul!<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>

<span class="i0">Upon her cheek! again her op'ning eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beams softened lustre! Kneeling by her side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dam&oelig;tas press'd her hand; in falt'ring words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Propos'd his am'rous suit. Her parents near,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">First poured in tender words their grateful hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then to Dam&oelig;tas gave the willing hand<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Flushed lively in his cheek, and fired his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With all the rapt'rous bliss of mutual love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He tried in vain to speak, for words, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Could ill express tumultuous joys like his;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stammer'd, blush'd, and thanked them in thought.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And now the fiery charioteer of day<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The sprightly music sounds, the youths advance,<br /></span>

<span class="drop-cap2 in-poem"><span class="drop-cap-7">I</span>F from the public way you turn your steps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You will suppose that with an upright path<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Your feet must struggle; in such bold ascent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pastoral mountains front you, face to face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, courage! for around that boisterous brook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mountains have all opened out themselves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made a hidden valley of their own.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No habitation can be seen; but they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who journey thither find themselves alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a few sheep, with rocks and stones, and kites<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That overhead are sailing in the sky.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is in truth an utter solitude;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor should I have made mention of this dell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for one object which you might pass by&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Might see and notice not. Beside the brook<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Appears a straggling heap of unhewn stones!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to that place a story appertains,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, though it be ungarnished with events,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is not unfit, I deem, for the fireside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or for the summer shade. It was the first<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of those domestic tales that spake to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of shepherds, dwellers in the valleys, men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I already loved:&mdash;not verily<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For their own sakes, but for the fields and hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where was their occupation and abode.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hence this tale, while I was yet a boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Careless of books, yet having felt the power<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nature, by the gentle agency<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of natural objects led me on to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For passions that were not my own, and think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(At random and imperfectly indeed)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On man, the heart of man, and human life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, although it be a history<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Homely and rude, I will relate the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the delight of a few natural hearts:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with yet fonder feeling, for the sake<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of youthful poets, who among these hills<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will be my second self when I am gone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Upon the forest-side in Grasmere Vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There dwelt a shepherd, Michael was his name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old man, stout of heart, and strong of limb.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bodily frame had been from youth to age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an unusual strength; his mind was keen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Intense, and frugal, apt for all affairs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his shepherd's calling he was prompt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And watchful more than ordinary men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hence had he learned the meaning of all winds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of blasts of every tone; and, oftentimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When others heeded not, he heard the south<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make subterraneous music, like the noise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of bagpipers on distant Highland hills.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd, at such warning, of his flock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bethought him, and he to himself would say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The winds are now devising work for me!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, truly, at all times, the storm&mdash;that drives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The traveller to a shelter&mdash;summoned him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the mountains: he had been alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the heart of many thousand mists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came to him and left him on the heights.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So lived he till his eightieth year was past.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And grossly that man errs, who should suppose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the green valleys, and the streams and rocks<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Were things indifferent to the shepherd's thoughts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fields, where with cheerful spirits he had breathed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The common air; the hills, which he so oft<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had climbed with vigorous steps; which had impressed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So many incidents upon his mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hardship, skill, or courage, joy or fear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which like a book preserved the memory<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the dumb animals whom he had saved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fed or sheltered, linking to such acts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So grateful in themselves, the certainty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of honourable gain; these fields, these hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which were his living being, even more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than his own blood&mdash;what could they less? had laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strong hold on his affections, were to him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pleasurable feeling of blind love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pleasure which there is in life itself.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">His days had not been passed in singleness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His helpmate was a comely matron, old&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though younger than himself full twenty years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a woman of a stirring life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose heart was in her house: two wheels she had<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of antique form, this large for spinning wool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That small for flax; and if one wheel had rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was because the other was at work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pair had but one inmate in their house,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An only child, who had been born to them<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Michael, telling o'er his years, began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deem that he was old&mdash;in shepherd's phrase,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With one foot in the grave. This only son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With two brave sheep-dogs tried in many a storm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one of an inestimable worth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made all their household. I may truly say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That they were as a proverb in the vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For endless industry. When day was gone,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And from their occupations out of doors<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The son and father were come home, even then,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their labour did not cease; unless when all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned to their cleanly supper-board, and there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each with a mess of pottage and skimmed milk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sat round their basket piled with oaten cakes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And their plain home-made cheese. Yet when their meal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was ended, Luke (for so the son was named)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his old father both betook themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To such convenient work as might employ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their hands by the fireside; perhaps to card wool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the housewife's spindle, or repair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some injury done to sickle, flail, or scythe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or other implement of house or field.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Down from the ceiling, by the chimney's edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That in our ancient uncouth country style<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did with a huge projection overbrow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Large space beneath, as duly as the light<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of day grew dim the housewife hung a lamp;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An aged utensil, which had performed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Service beyond all others of its kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Early at evening did it burn and late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Surviving comrade of uncounted hours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which going by from year to year had found<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the couple neither gay perhaps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor cheerful, yet with objects and with hopes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Living a life of eager industry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now when Luke had reached his eighteenth year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There by the light of this old lamp they sat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Father and son, while late into the night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The housewife plied her own peculiar work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making the cottage through the silent hours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Murmur as with the sound of summer flies.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This light was famous in its neighbourhood,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And was a public symbol of the life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thrifty pair had lived. For, as it chanced,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their cottage on a plot of rising ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood single, with large prospect, north and south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">High into Easedale, up to Dunmail-Raise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And westward to the village near the lake;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And from this constant light, so regular<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so far seen, the house itself, by all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who dwelt within the limits of the vale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both old and young, was named The Evening Star.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thus living on through such a length of years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd, if he loved himself, must needs<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have loved his helpmate; but to Michael's heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This son of his old age was yet more dear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Less from instinctive tenderness, the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blind spirit, which is in the blood of all&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than that a child, more than all other gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brings hope with it, and forward-looking thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stirrings of inquietude, when they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By tendency of nature needs must fail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Exceeding was the love he bare to him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His heart, and his heart's joy! For oftentimes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Old Michael, while he was a babe in arms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had done him female service, not alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For pastime and delight, as is the use<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fathers, but with patient mind enforced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To acts of tenderness; and he had rocked<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His cradle with a woman's gentle hand.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And, in a latter time, ere yet the boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had put on boy's attire, did Michael love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Albeit of a stern unbending mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To have the young one in his sight, when he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had work by his own door, or when he sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sheep before him on his shepherd's stool,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath that large old oak, which near their door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood&mdash;and, from its enormous breadth of shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Chosen for the shearer's covert from the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thence in our rustic dialect was called<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Clipping Tree,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> a name which yet it bears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There while they two were sitting in the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With others round them, earnest all and blythe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would Michael exercise his heart with looks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of fond correction and reproof bestowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the child, if he disturbed the sheep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By catching at their legs, or with his shouts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scared them, while they lay still beneath the shears.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And when by heaven's good grace the boy grew up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A healthy lad, and carried in his cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two steady roses that were five years old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then Michael from a winter coppice cut<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his own hands a sapling, which he hooped<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With iron, making it throughout in all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Due requisites a perfect shepherd's staff,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gave it to the boy; wherewith equipp'd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He as a watchman oftentimes was placed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At gate or gap, to stem or turn the flock;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, to his office prematurely called,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There stood the urchin, as you will divine,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something between a hinderance and a help;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for this cause not always, I believe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Receiving from his father hire of praise;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though nought was left undone which staff, or voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or looks, or threatening gestures could perform.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But soon as Luke, full ten years old, could stand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the mountain blasts; and to the heights,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not fearing toil, nor length of weary ways,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
<span class="i0">He with his father daily went, and they<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were as companions, why should I relate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That objects which the shepherd loved before<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were dearer now? that from the boy there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feelings and emanations&mdash;things which were<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Light to the sun and music to the wind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that the old man's heart seemed born again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Thus in his father's sight the boy grew up:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now when he had reached his eighteenth year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was his comfort and his daily hope.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">While in this sort the simple household lived<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From day to day, to Michael's ear there came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Distressful tidings. Long before the time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of which I speak, the shepherd had been bound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In surety for his brother's son, a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an industrious life, and ample means;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But unforeseen misfortunes suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had prest upon him, and old Michael now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was summoned to discharge the forfeiture;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A grievous penalty, but little less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than half his substance. This unlooked-for claim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the first hearing, for a moment took<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More hope out of his life than he supposed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That any old man ever could have lost.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As soon as he had gathered so much strength<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he could look his trouble in the face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seemed that his whole refuge was to sell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A portion of his patrimonial fields.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such was his first resolve; he thought again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And his heart failed him. "Isabel," said he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two evenings after he had heard the news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I have been toiling more than seventy years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the open sunshine of God's love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have we all lived; yet if these fields of ours<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Should pass into a stranger's hand, I think<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I could not lie quiet in my grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our lot is a hard lot; the sun himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has scarcely been more diligent than I;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I have lived to be a fool at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To my own family. An evil man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That was, and made an evil choice, if he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were false to us; and if he were not false,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are ten thousand to whom loss like this<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had been no sorrow. I forgive him; but<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere better to be dumb than to talk thus.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I began, my purpose was to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of remedies and of a cheerful hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our Luke shall leave us, Isabel; the land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not go from us, and it shall be free;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He shall possess it, free as is the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That passes over it. We have, thou know'st,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another kinsman, he will be our friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this distress. He is a prosperous man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thriving in trade, and Luke to him shall go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with his kinsman's help and his own thrift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He quickly will repair this loss, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May come again to us. If here he stay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can be done? Where every one is poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What can be gained?" At this the old man paused,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Isabel sat silent, for her mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was busy looking back into past times.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's Richard Bateman, thought she to herself,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was a parish-boy; at the church door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made a gathering for him&mdash;shillings, pence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And halfpennies, wherewith the neighbours bought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A basket, which they filled with pedlar's wares;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, with this basket on his arm, the lad<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went up to London, found a master there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who out of many, chose the trusty boy<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To go and overlook his merchandize<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the seas; where he grew wondrous rich,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left estates and monies to the poor,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And at his birth-place built a chapel, floored<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With marble which he sent from foreign lands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These thoughts and many others of like sort,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Passed quickly through the mind of Isabel,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And her face brightened. The old man was glad,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus resumed:&mdash;"Well, Isabel! this scheme<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These two days has been meat and drink to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Far more than we have lost is left us yet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have enough; I wish indeed that I<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were younger; but this hope is a good hope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make ready Luke's best garments, of the best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Buy for him more, and let us send him forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow, or the next day, or to-night:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If he could go, the boy should go to-night."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Michael ceased, and to the fields went forth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a light heart. The housewife for five days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was restless morn and night, and all day long<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought on with her best fingers to prepare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things needful for the journey of her son.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Isabel was glad when Sunday came<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To stop her in her work; for, when she lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By Michael's side, she through the last two nights<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heard him, how he was troubled in his sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when they rose at morning she could see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That all his hopes were gone. That day at noon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said to Luke, while they two by themselves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were sitting at the door, "Thou must not go:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We have no other child but thee to lose,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None to remember&mdash;do not go away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For if thou leave thy father he will die."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The youth made answer with a jocund voice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Isabel, when she had told her fears,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Recovered heart. That evening her best fare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did she bring forth, and all together sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like happy people round a Christmas fire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">With daylight Isabel resumed her work;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the ensuing week the house appeared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As cheerful as a grove in spring: at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The expected letter from their kinsman came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With kind assurances that he would do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His utmost for the welfare of the boy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To which requests were added, that forthwith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He might be sent to him. Ten times or more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The letter was read over; Isabel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went forth to show it to the neighbours round;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor was there at that time on English land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prouder heart than Luke's. When Isabel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had to her house returned, the old man said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"He shall depart to-morrow." To this word<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The housewife answered, talking much of things<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which if at such short notice he should go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would surely be forgotten. But at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gave consent, and Michael was at ease.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Near the tumultuous brook of Green-head Ghyll,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that deep valley, Michael had designed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To build a sheepfold; and, before he heard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The tidings of his melancholy loss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For this same purpose he had gathered up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heap of stones, which by the streamlet's edge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay thrown together, ready for the work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With Luke that evening thitherward he walked;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And soon as they had reached the place he stopped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus the old man spake to him:&mdash;"My son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-morrow thou wilt leave me: with full heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I look upon thee, for thou art the same<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wert a promise to me ere thy birth,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
<span class="i0">And all thy life hast been my daily joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will relate to thee some little part<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our two histories: 'twill do thee good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou art from me; even if I should speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of things thou canst not know of.&mdash;&mdash;After thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First cam'st into the world&mdash;as oft befals<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To new-born infants&mdash;thou didst sleep away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two days, and blessings from thy father's tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then fell upon thee. Day by day passed on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still I loved thee with increasing love.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never to living ear came sweeter sounds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than when I heard thee by our own fireside<br /></span>
<span class="i0">First uttering, without words, a natural tune;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou, a feeble babe, didst in thy joy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sing at thy mother's breast. Month followed month,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in the open fields my life was passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And on the mountains, else I think that thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had'st been brought up upon thy father's knees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we were playmates, Luke: among these hills,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As well thou know'st in us, the old and young<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have played together, nor with me didst thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lack any pleasure which a boy can know."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Luke had a manly heart; but at these words<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sobbed aloud. The old man grasped his hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And said, "Nay, do not take it so: I see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That these are things of which I need not speak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even to the utmost I have been to thee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind and a good father; and herein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I but repay a gift which I myself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Received at others' hands; for, though now old<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the common life of man, I still<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember them who loved me in my youth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both of them sleep together: here they lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As all their forefathers had done; and when<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At length their time was come, they were not loth<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
<span class="i0">To give their bodies to the family mould.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish that thou shouldst live the life they lived:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But 'tis a long time to look back, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And see so little gain from threescore years.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These fields were burthened when they came to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till I was forty years of age, not more<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than half of my inheritance was mine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I toiled and toiled: God bless'd me in my work,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And till these three weeks past the land was free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It looks as if it never could endure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another master. Heaven forgive me, Luke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I judge ill for thee, but it seems good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That thou shouldst go." At this the old man paused;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then pointing to the stones near which they stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus, after a short silence, he resumed:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This was a work for us, and now, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is a work for me; but lay one stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here; lay it for me, Luke, with thine own hands.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay, boy, be of good hope; we both may live<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see a better day. At eighty-four<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I still am strong and hale: do thou thy part,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will do mine. I will begin again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many tasks that were resigned to thee;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the heights, and in among the storms,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will I without thee go again, and do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All works which I was wont to do alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before I knew thy face. Heaven bless thee, boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy heart these two weeks has been beating fast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With many hopes; it should be so: yes, yes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew that thou couldst never have a wish<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave me, Luke; thou hast been bound to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only by links of love; when thou art gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What will be left to us! But I forget<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My purposes. Lay now the corner-stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As I requested; and hereafter, Luke,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
<span class="i0">When thou art gone away, should evil men<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be thy companions, think of me, my son,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And of this moment: hither turn thy thoughts,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And God will strengthen thee: amid all fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all temptation, Luke, I pray that thou<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mayst bear in mind the life thy fathers lived,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, being innocent, did for that cause<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bestir them in good deeds. Now, fare-thee-well;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When thou return'st, thou in this place wilt see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A work which is not here&mdash;a covenant&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twill be between us. But, whatever fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Befal thee, I shall love thee to the last.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bear thy memory with me to the grave."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The shepherd ended here, and Luke stooped down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, as his father had requested, laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The first stone of the sheepfold. At the sight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The old man's grief broke from him, to his heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He pressed his son, he kissed him and wept;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to the house together they returned.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hushed was that house in peace, or seeming peace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ere the night fell; with morrow's dawn the boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Began his journey, and when he had reached<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The public way, he put on a bold face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the neighbours, as he passed their doors,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came forth with wishes and with farewell prayers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That followed him till he was out of sight.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A good report did from their kinsman come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Luke and his well-doing; and the boy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrote loving letters, full of wondrous news,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which, as the housewife phrased it, were, throughout,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The prettiest letters that were ever seen."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both parents read them with rejoicing hearts.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So, many months passed on, and once again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The shepherd went about his daily work<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
<span class="i0">With confident and cheerful thoughts; and now<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes when he could find a leisure hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He to that valley took his way, and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wrought at the sheepfold. Meantime Luke began<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To slacken in his duty; and at length<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He in the dissolute city gave himself<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To evil courses; ignominy and shame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell on him, so that he was driven at last<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To seek a hiding place beyond the seas.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There is a comfort in the strength of love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twill make a thing endurable, which else<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Would overset the brain, or break the heart.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have conversed with more than one who well<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Remember the old man, and what he was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Years after he had heard this heavy news.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His bodily frame had been from youth to age<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an unusual strength. Among the rocks<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He went, and still looked up upon the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And listened to the wind; and, as before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Performed all kinds of labour for his sheep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And for the land, his small inheritance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to that hollow dell from time to time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did he repair, to build the fold of which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His flock had need. 'Tis not forgotten yet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pity which was then in every heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the old man: and 'tis believed by all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That many and many a day he thither went,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And never lifted up a single stone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">There, by the sheepfold, sometimes was he seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sitting alone, with that his faithful dog,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then old, beside him lying at his feet.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The length of full seven years from time to time<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He at the building of this sheepfold wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left the work unfinished when he died.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Three years, or little more, did Isabel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Survive her husband: at her death the estate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was sold, and went into a stranger's hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cottage, which was named the Evening Star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is gone; the ploughshare has been through the ground<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which it stood; great changes have been wrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In all the neighbourhood; yet the oak is left<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That grew beside their door; and the remains<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the unfinished sheepfold may be seen<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-4">O</span>UR boatman told us, that at a short distance on the
eastern side of Windermere lake, were some inscriptions
on the rocks, which were the greatest curiosities
of the place. The guide-book having made no mention
of them, we were the more anxious to see what they were,
and were rowed ashore accordingly, at a point not far from
Lowood Inn. Here we found every smooth surface afforded
by the rocks&mdash;every slab on the stratified formation&mdash;covered
with inscriptions, engraved with much toil, in
letters varying from six to twenty or twenty-four inches
in height. On one large red stone of at least ten feet
square, was engraved "1833. <span class="smcap">Money. Liberty. Wealth.
Peace</span>;"&mdash;a catalogue of blessings very much to be desired.
On another stone was the simple date "1688:" expressive
enough of the engraver's political sentiments. And on
another, in larger characters, "<span class="smcap">A slave landing on the
British strand, becomes free</span>."</p>

<p>All the largest stones, and slabs, some of which were
horizontal, others vertical, and the rest inclined at various
angles, and the whole of them giving evidence that the
place had formerly been a quarry, were covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
inscriptions of a like purport. The following are a few of
the most striking. One immense surface of rock bore the
following names, which are transcribed in the original
order:&mdash;"<span class="smcap">Sun. Bulwer. Dryden. Davy. Burns. Scott.
Burdett. Garrick. Kemble. Gray. Kean. Milton.
Henry Brougham. James Watt. Professor Wilson.
Dr. Jenner.</span>" To which were added the words in characters
equally conspicuous, "<span class="smcap">The Liberty of the Press</span>."
"<span class="smcap">Magna Charta.</span>" This slab was a testimony, apparently,
of the engraver's admiration of great intellect. One close
alongside side of it was of a different style, and bore the
date "1836," followed by the words, "<span class="smcap">William IV.
President Jackson. Louis Philippe. Britannia rules
the waves</span>." Next to that again was a still larger surface
of rock on which was indented, "<span class="smcap">National Debt</span>,
£800,000,000. <span class="smcap">O save my Country, Heaven! George

stone, at least eight feet square, bore but one word in letters

<p>On inquiring of the boatman who it was that had expended
so much labour, he pointed out another stone, on
which were the words, "John Longmire, Engraver," and
informed us that it was a person of that name, who had
spent about six years of his prime in this work&mdash;labouring
here alone, and in all weathers&mdash;and both by night and by
day. He took great pleasure in the task; and was, as the
boatman took pains to impress upon us, rather "dull"
at the time. This phrase, as he afterwards explained,
implies, in this part of the country, that he was deranged;
and I thought, when looking with renewed interest upon
these mementos of his ingenuity and perseverance, misapplied
though they were, that it was a happy circumstance
that an afflicted creature could have found solace under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
calamity, in a manner so harmless. There was a method in
the work, and a sense, too, in the poor man's ideas, which
showed that his sympathies were in favour of the moral
and intellectual advancement of mankind; and that, amid
the last feeble glimmerings of his own reason, he could do
honour to those whose intellect had benefited and adorned
our age. I could learn no further particulars of him; our
friend, the boatman, not being able to say whether he were
dead or alive, or whether his "dullness" had ever manifested
itself in a more disorderly manner than in these inscriptions.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-5">I</span>N the neighbourhood of Egremont, there is a romantic
hill called Wotobank, with which a traditionary story
is connected, and from which its name is said to have
originated. The tale relates that "a lord of Egremont,
with his lady Edwina and servants, was hunting the wolf;
during the chase, the lady was missing, and after a long
and painful search, her body was found lying on this
romantic acclivity, or bank, mangled by a wolf, which was
in the very act of ravenously tearing it to pieces. The
sorrow of the husband, in the first transports of his grief,
was expressed by the words&mdash;"Wo to this bank!"&mdash;whence
the hill obtained the name of "Wotobank." Mrs. Cowley
has adopted this legend for the subject of her beautiful
poem "Edwina." After ascending Skiddaw, and casting a
glance around:&mdash;</p>

<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_a.png" width="42" height="70" alt="A" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-1">A</span>S you enter the romantic vale of Yewdale, about a
quarter of a mile above the saw-mills, by looking
over the hedge to your right, you may perceive,
near to the verge of the precipitous bank of Yewdale
Beck, and a few yards from the roadside, a long narrow
mound which seems to be formed of solid stone covered
with moss, but which a nearer inspection would show to be
composed of several blocks fitted so closely together as to
prove the mound to have had an artificial, and not a
natural origin. You observe it is somewhere between three
and four yards long. That singular accumulation of lichen-clad
rock has been known for centuries amongst the
natives of Yewdale and the adjacent valleys, by the romance-suggesting
designation of Girt Will's Grave. How it came
by that name, and how Cauldron Dub and Yewdale Bridge
came to be haunted, my task is now to tell.</p>

<p>Some few hundred years ago, the inhabitants of these
contiguous dales were startled from their propriety, if they
had any, by a report that one of the Troutbeck giants had
built himself a hut, and taken up his abode in the lonely
dell of the Tarns, above Yewdale Head. Of course you
have read the history and exploits of the famous Tom Hickathrift,
and remembering that he was raised at Troutbeck,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
you will not be much surprised when I tell you that it was
always famous for a race of extraordinary size and strength;
for even in these our own puny days, the biggest man in
Westmoreland is to be found in that beautiful vale.</p>

<p>The excitement consequent upon the settlement of one of
that gigantic race in this vicinity soon died away, and the
object of it, who stood somewhere about nine feet six out of
his clogs, if they were in fashion then, and was broad in fair
proportion, became known to the neighbours as a capital
labourer, ready for any such work as was required in the
rude and limited agricultural operations of the period and
locality&mdash;answered to the cognomen of "Girt (great) Will
o' t' Tarns," and, once or twice, did good service as a billman
under the Knight of Conistone, when he was called upon to
muster his powers to assist in repelling certain roving bands
of Scots or Irish, who were wont, now and again, to invade
the wealthy plains of low Furness.</p>

<p>The particular Knight who was chief of the Flemings of
Conistone, at the period of the giant's location at the Tarns,
was far advanced in years, and, in addition to some six or
eight gallant and stately sons, had</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"One fair daughter, and no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The which he loved passing well."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And Eva le Fleming, called by the country people "the
Lady Eva," was famed throughout the broad north for her
beauty and gentleness, her high-bred dignity and her humble
virtues; but it is not with her that my story has to do.
She, like the mother of "the gentle lady married to the
Moor," had a maid called Barbara, an especial favourite
with her mistress, and, in her own sphere, deemed quite as
beautiful. In fact, it was hinted that, when she happened
to be in attendance upon her lady on festive or devotional
occasions, the eyes of even knights and well-born squires
were as often directed to the maid as to the mistress, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
seemed to express as much admiration in one direction as
the other.</p>

<p>And when mounted on the Lady Eva's own palfrey,
bedecked in its gayest trappings, she rode, as she oftentimes
did, to visit her parents at Skelwith, old and young were
struck with her beauty, and would turn, as she ambled past,
to gaze after her, and to wonder at the elegance of her figure,
the ease of her deportment, and the all-surpassing loveliness
of her features. Her lady, notwithstanding the disparity of
their rank, loved her as a sister, and it was whispered
amongst her envious fellow-servants, that her mistress's
fondness made her assume airs unbecoming her station.
True enough it was that she seemed sufficiently haughty
and scornful in her reception of the homage paid to her
charms by the young men of her own rank, and by many
above it. The only one to whom she showed the slightest
courtesy on these occasions was wild Dick Hawksley, the
Knight's falconer, and he was also the only one who appeared
to care no more for her favours than for her frowns.</p>

<p>The Lady Eva, as well befits high-born dames, was somewhat
romantic in her tastes, and would often row for hours
upon the lake, and wander for miles through the woods, or
even upon the mountains, unattended, save by her favourite
bower-maiden. And one evening in autumn, after having
been confined for two whole days to the hall, by heavy and
incessant rain, tired of playing chess with her father, and
battledore with her younger brothers, or superintending the
needlework of her maids, and tempted by the brilliant
moonlight and now unobscured skies, she summoned
Barbara, and set out upon a stroll by the lake side.</p>

<p>The pair were sauntering along a path cut through the
dense coppice, the lady leaning in condescending affection
upon the shoulder of her maiden, and listening to a recital
of how, on her return from some of her visits to her parents,
she had been waylaid by Great Will of the Tarns, and how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
on a recent evening he had attempted to seize her rein, and
would have stopped her, had she not whipped the palfrey
and bounded past him. The lady was expressing her indignation
at this insolence, when a gigantic figure sprang upon
the pathway, and, snatching up the screaming Barbara with
the same ease with which she herself would have lifted an
infant, vanished on the instant amongst the thick hazels.</p>

<p>The Lady Eva stood for a minute struck powerless with
terror and astonishment at this audacious outrage; but the
sound of the monster crashing his headlong course through
the coppice, and the half-stifled screams of his captive, soon
recalled her suspended faculties, and then</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Fair" Eva "through the hazel-grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flew, like a startled cushat dove,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>back to the hall, where, breathless with terror and exertion,
she gave the alarm that Barbara had been carried off by
the giant. There was noisy and instantaneous commotion
amongst the carousing gentles at the upper, and the loitering
lacqueys at the lower end of the hall. Dick Hawksley, and
a few more, darted off in immediate pursuit on foot, while
several rushed to the stables, in obedience to the call of
their young masters, who were, one and all, loudly vociferating
for their horses. Scarce a minute passed, ere half a dozen
Flemings, attended by as many mounted followers, were
spurring like lightning through the wood in the direction
of Yewdale. They came in sight of the giant and his
burthen as he neared Cauldron Dub, with the light-heeled
falconer close behind, calling loudly upon him to stay his
flight; but he held on with tremendous strides, till he
reached the brow over the pool, when, finding that the
horsemen were close upon him, and that it was hopeless to
try to carry his prize farther, he stopped&mdash;uttered one
terrible shout of rage and disappointment&mdash;and whirled his
shrieking victim into the flooded beck, resuming his now
unencumbered flight with increased speed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>Dick Hawksley rushed over the bank a little lower down,
and the horsemen, abandoning the chase, galloped to the
brink of the stream, which was high with the recent rains.
They saw the falconer plunge into the torrent, as the bower
maiden, yet buoyant with her light garments, was borne
rapidly down. They saw him seize her with one hand, and
strike out gallantly for the bank with the other, but the
current was too strong for him, encumbered as he was with
the girl in his grasp. The devoted pair were swept down
the stream, at a rate that made the spectators put their
horses to a gallop to keep them in sight, even while the
exertions of the brave falconer sufficed to sustain their heads
above water, which was only till they came under the
bridge, where the water, pent in by the narrow arch, acquired
four-fold force, and there they heard him utter a hoarse cry
of despair, and the gallant Hawksley and the Lady Eva's
beauteous favourite were seen no more, till their bodies
were found, days after, on the shore far down the lake.</p>

<p>One or two of the horsemen continued to gallop down the
side of the beck, in the bootless hope of being able even yet
to render them some aid, but the most of them turned their
horses' heads, and went off once more at their utmost speed
in pursuit of the murderous giant. He, considering the
chase at an end, had slackened his pace, and they were not
long in overtaking him. Great Will struck out manfully
with his club (time out of mind the giant's favourite weapon)
as they rushed upon him, but they speedily surrounded
him, and, amid a storm of vengeful yells and bitter execrations,
the Giant of the Tarns was stretched upon the sward,
"with the blood running like a little brook" from a hundred
wounds; for he was so frightfully slashed and mangled by
their swords, that, as my informant naively averred, there
was not so much whole skin left upon his huge body as
would have made a tobacco-pouch.</p>

<p>It will be apparent enough to the most obtuse intellect,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
that, after such events as these, the localities where they
occurred must, of necessity, be haunted; and, as the ghosts
of murderers, as well as of murderees, if they be right
orthodox apparitions, always appear to be re-enacting the
closing scene of their earthly career, it is scarcely required
of me to dilate farther upon the manner of their appearance.
Of course I do not expect, and certainly do not wish to be
called upon to prove the even-down truth of every particular
of the story, with which I have been doing my little best to
amuse you; but the assured fact of the Dub and the bridge
being haunted, and that by sundry most pertinacious spirits,
I am ready to maintain against all comers.</p>

<span class="smaller">A LEGEND.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_n.png" width="38" height="70" alt="N" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-2">N</span>EAR to the bridge which crosses the Lune, not far
from Kirkby Lonsdale, the scenery is truly romantic.
The river, which is here of considerable width, winds
through the bottom of the valley, and is overshadowed
by the trees that grow upon its banks. Its
current is roughened by the rocks which form its bed, some
of which stand up in huge moss-grown blocks in the midst
of the stream. The water is clear to a great depth, and the
steep grassy banks, and abundance of trees which close in
the prospect, give it an air of seclusion. This stream is
plentifully stocked with trout and salmon, and here the
angler may sit and watch the gilded fly with a devotion
worthy of a Davy or a Walton.</p>

<p>The singular construction of the bridge renders it an
object of curiosity; and when viewed in connection with
the river and valley of the Lune, it forms one of the most
romantic prospects on which the eye can dwell. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
composed of three beautifully ribbed arches, the centre one
rising to the height of thirty-six feet above the stream.
It is a lofty, firm and handsome structure, but so narrow
as almost to deserve the taunt cast upon the "auld brig of
Ayr:"&mdash;</p>

<p>"Where twa wheelbarrows trembled when they met:"
at least no two carriages of a larger size can pass each
other; but, for the security of the foot passengers, there are
angular recesses in the battlements, corresponding with the
projecting piers.</p>

<p>Antiquity has cast her veil over this erection, and a
consequent obscurity envelopes its history. If, however,
we may rely on popular tradition, the building is to be
ascribed to an unmentionable personage; of whom it is
said, "that he built the bridge one windy night, and that in
fetching the stones from a distance, he let fall the last apronfull
as he flew over a fell hard by." This gentleman has
been "a bridge-builder," "time out of mind," notwithstanding
the improbability of his employing "himself in works
of so much real utility to men." Such an historical fact
may, however, account for the huge blocks of stone found
in various parts of the neighbouring moors.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-2">S</span>OUTER FELL, or Soutra Fell as it is sometimes called,
is a considerable mountain situated to the eastward
of Skiddaw and Blencathara. The west and north
sides are barricaded with steep rocks, apparently 900
yards in height, and everywhere difficult of access.</p>

<p>A very remarkable phenomenon has exhibited itself on
this mountain, which, though difficult to account for satisfactorily,
is too well authenticated by numerous spectators
to be discredited. We allude to the appearance of troops
of visionary horsemen, crossing the mountains, advancing,
retreating, and performing different military evolutions&mdash;an
optical delusion which has been observed in this vicinity,
to the great astonishment of the rustics of the vale.</p>

<p class="right blockquot"><span class="smcap">Thomson.</span></p>

<p>The following account of this singular appearance, which
is scarcely paralleled in history, is contained in Hutchison's
History of Cumberland, the particulars being collected by
Mr. Smith, who observes that he went himself to examine
the spectators, who asserted the facts very positively. "On
midsummer eve, 1735, a servant in the employ of William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
Lancaster, of Blakehills, about half a mile from Souterfell,
related that he saw the east side of the mountain, towards
the summit, covered with a regular marching army for above
an hour together. They consisted of distinct bodies of
troops, which appeared to proceed from an eminence in the
north end, and marched over a niche in the top, marked A
and B in the sketch given in the above work; but as no
other person in the neighbourhood had seen a similar
appearance, he was discredited and laughed at.</p>

<p>"Two years after, on midsummer eve also, between the
hours of eight and nine, William Lancaster himself imagined
that several gentlemen were following their horses at a
distance, as if they had been hunting; and taking them for
such, paid no regard to it, till about ten minutes after, again
turning his head towards the place, they appeared to be
mounted, and a vast army following, five in rank, crowding
over at the same place, where the servant said he saw them
two years before. He then called his family, who all agreed
in the same opinion; and what was most extraordinary, he
frequently observed that some one of the five would quit
the ranks, and seem to stand in a fronting posture, as if he
was observing and regulating the order of their march, or
taking account of the numbers, and after some time
appeared to return full-gallop to the station he had left,
which they never failed to do as often as they quitted their
lines, and the figure that did so was generally one of the
middlemost men in the rank. As it grew later, they seemed
more regardless of discipline, and rather had the appearance
of people riding from a market, than an army, though they
continued crowding on, and marching off, as long as there
was light to see them."</p>

<p>This phenomenon was no more observed till the remarkably
serene midsummer evening which preceded the last
Scotch rebellion. The parties who had witnessed it on the
previous occasion, having been much ridiculed for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
report, were determined to call a greater number of
witnesses of this strange phenomenon; and having first
observed it rigidly, and with great caution themselves, and
being fully assured they were not deceived as to the actual
appearances, they convened about twenty-six persons from
different places in the neighbourhood to bear testimony to
the existence of the fact. These all affirmed, and attested
before a magistrate, that they saw a similar appearance to
that just described, but not conducted with the same
regularity, having also the appearance of carriages interspersed.
The numbers of the troops were incredible, for
they filled lengthways nearly half a mile, and continued so
in a brisk march for above an hour, and would probably
have done so much longer had not the darkness of approaching
night intervened.</p>

<p>The horse and man, upon strict looking at, appeared to
be but one being, rather than two distinct ones, but they
did not at all resemble clouds or vapours of any kind.</p>

<p>William Lancaster observed that he never considered
these aërial images to be real beings, because of the
impracticability of a march over the precipices they seemed
to traverse, where horses' hoofs had never trod before.
They did not, however, appear to be any less real than on
the former occasion; for so convinced were the spectators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
of the reality of what they had seen, that, as soon as the
sun had dawned next morning, several of them climbed the
mountain, through an idle expectation of finding the marks
of horses' feet, after so numerous an army; but when they
arrived at the supposed scene of action, not the mark of a
single hoof was discernible, nor have any tidings been
received of troops being in the neighbourhood up to this
time.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>Though this part of the country, like every other, where
cultivation has been lately introduced, abounds in all the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">aniles fabell&aelig;</i> of fairies, ghosts, and apparitions, these are
never even fabled to have been seen by more than one or
two persons at a time, and the view is always said to be
momentary. But in this case the twenty-six spectators
saw all alike the same changes, and at the same time, as
they discovered by asking each other questions as any
change took place. Nor was this wonderful phenomenon
observed by these individuals only; it was seen by every
person, at every cottage, for a mile round; neither was it
confined to a momentary view; for, from the time it was
first observed, the appearance must have lasted at least two
hours and a half, viz., from half-past seven, till the night
coming on prevented the further view; nor yet was the
distance such as could impose rude resemblances on the
eyes of credulity. The whole story has certainly much of
the air of a romance, and it may appear to some fittest for
Amadis de Gaul, or Glenville's System of Witches, than
for insertion here as a fact. But although it may be
difficult to reconcile its probability, and beyond even
philosophy to explain, yet such is the evidence we have of
its occurrence, that I do not myself entertain the slightest
doubt of its having actually taken place as here related.
The whole, however, was unquestionably an optical delusion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>As instances have frequently occurred in which the forms
and action of human beings have been pictured in the clouds,
or in vapour, it seems highly probable, on a consideration
of all the circumstances of the case, that certain vapours
must have hovered round the mountain when these appearances
were observed. It is also possible that these vapours
may have been impressed with the shadowy forms which
seemed to "imitate humanity," by a particular operation of
the sun's rays, united with some singular, but unknown,
refractive combination then taking place in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>It has been remarked that these appearances were
observed most particularly on the eve of the last Scotch
Rebellion, when troops of horsemen might be privately
exercising at no great distance. Indeed, the Editor of the
<cite>Lonsdale Magazine</cite>, without giving his authority, observes,
that it was afterwards actually discovered "to have been
the rebels exercising on the western coast of Scotland,
whose movements had been reflected by some fine transparent
vapour similar to the Fata Morgana."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>Instances are recorded of the phenomena of spectral armies
having been occasionally witnessed in other localities. It
has been stated that a troop of phantom horsemen was seen
coursing over the heights of Helvellyn the day before the
battle of Marston Moor.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Hutchinson, in his <cite>History of
Cumberland</cite>, relates the following as a parallel instance
with that of Soutra Fell. In the spring of 1707, early in a
serene morning, was observed by two persons in Leicestershire
an appearance of an army marching along, till going
behind a great hill it disappeared. The forms of pikes, and
carbines were distinguishable; the march was not entirely
in one direction, but was at the first like the junction of
two armies, and the meeting of generals.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> There is also a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
well-authenticated statement of a similar phenomenon,
witnessed not long ago, on the Mendip Hills, in Somersetshire;<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and Speed tells us of something of a like nature as
preceding a dreadful intestine war.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> Something of this
kind may have given rise to Ossian's grand and awful
mythology.</p>

<p>These optical illusions, occurring on Soutra Fell, form a
subject peculiarly adapted for "the poet's pen," and are
finely illustrated in the following poem, written in conformity
with the popular belief of the lake villagers, that it
really was a presentiment of the Scotch Rebellion, and that
the horrors of the final battle were depicted in a prophetic
manner. There can be no impiety in supposing, as this
happened immediately before that rebellion which was
intended to subvert the liberty, the law, and the religion of
England, that though immediate prophecies may have
ceased, these visionary beings might be directed to warn
mankind of approaching tumults.</p>

<p>Another curious and interesting phenomenon was once
observed on Souter Fell, somewhat differing from that
already described, though probably resulting from the same
combined causes. "One summer evening, in the year 1743,
the servant of Mr. Wren, of Wilton Hall, was sitting at the
door with his master, when they both saw the figure of a
man with a dog, pursuing some horses along the mountain
side, a place so steep that a horse could scarcely keep his
footing upon it. These visionary forms appeared to run at
an amazing pace, till they got out of sight at the lower end
of the Fell. Mr. Wren and his servant next morning
ascended the steep mountain, expecting to find the man
dead, being persuaded he must be killed in galloping at so
furious a rate; but to their surprise, they found not a shoe,
nor even any vestige whatever of man, dog, or horse."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
This story they sometime concealed; at length, however,
they ventured to relate it, and were (as might be expected),
heartily laughed at.</p>

<p>Nearly allied to this is another atmospheric phenomenon,
occasionally seen among the mountains, though of rare
occurrence. It consists of an aërial figure, depicted on a
dense or misty atmosphere, not unfrequently assuming a
grotesque or highly magnified appearance. The same
phenomenon has been observed amongst the Scotch mountains.
Mr. Smith, M.P. for Norwich, witnessed it in ascending
Ben Nevis. On the crown of that mountain there is a
crater-like hollow, in which was a misty vapour. In the
midst of this appeared a human figure in motion. Mr.
Smith held up his hands, and the figure did the same.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>This appearance is most rationally explained on the
principles of refraction and reflection, the shadowy form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
being no other than the image of a reality, favourably
posited with relation to the refracting medium and the
observer's eye. This man-in-the-mist was doubtless the
shadow of the real man, created by his coming between the
vapour and the sun; yet perhaps the aërial beings that have
been said to people the Highland mountains, may be traced
to some such origin.</p>

<p>The appearance of the Spectre of the Broken, an aërial
figure which is sometimes seen amongst the Hartz mountains
of Hanover, may be accounted for in the same manner. The
following is an interesting account of this phenomenon by
M. Hane:&mdash;"Having ascended the Broken Mountain," says
he, "for the thirtieth time, I was at length so fortunate as
to have the pleasure of seeing this phenomenon. The sun
rose about four o'clock, and the atmosphere being quite
serene towards the east, its rays could pass without any
obstruction over the Heinrichshöhe mountain. In the south-west,
however, towards the mountain Achtermannshöhe, a
brisk west wind carried before it thin transparent vapours.
About a quarter-past four I looked round, to see whether
the atmosphere would permit me to have a free prospect to
the south-west, when I observed, at a very great distance
towards the Achtermannshöhe, a human figure of a monstrous
size! A violent gust of wind having almost carried away
my hat, I clapped my hand to it: and in moving my arm
towards my head, the colossal figure did the same.</p>

<p>"The pleasure which I felt at this discovery can hardly
be described; for I had already walked many a weary step
in the hope of seeing this shadowy image, without being
able to gratify my curiosity. I immediately made another
movement, by bending my body, and the colossal figure
before me repeated it. I was desirous of doing the same
thing once more, but my colossus had vanished. I remained
in the same position, waiting to see whether it would return;
and in a few minutes it again made its appearance on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
Achtermannshöhe. I then called the landlord of the neighbouring
inn, and having both taken the position which I
had taken alone, we looked towards the Achtermannshöhe,
but did not perceive anything. We had not, however, stood
long, when two such colossal figures were formed over the
above eminence, which repeated their compliments, by bending
their bodies as we did, after which they vanished. We
retained our position, kept our eyes fixed on the spot, and

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-1">A</span>MONG the various traits of local character in the
English Lake district, there is not perhaps, one more
amusing than that propensity to rhyming which a
number of individuals has exhibited, in all the
rustic grace of native ignorance. A few instances of this
nature can only be admitted within the limited compass of
these pages, but they will not be without their interest to
those who feel a pleasure in tracing the unassisted efforts of
natural genius.</p>

<p>John Oldland was an inhabitant of Crosthwaite, existing
about the beginning of the last century. His propensity to
rhyming was such, that many of his rhymes, as they are
provincially called, are still repeated by the older inhabitants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
of the neighbourhood. A few, and but a few of these
rhymes, we shall here insert.</p>

<p>When he attended Ulverston market, as he generally did,
he put up at the Dog, in Dalton Gate, then kept by Betty
Woodburn and her husband, though now gone and forgotten.
Audland, as he was called, was so much addicted to rhyming,
that he did it on all occasions with various success; the
following, though still remembered, is one of his clumsy
attempts:&mdash;Calling one Thursday at the public-house door
with some other farmers, the landlord replied in his politest
manner, "Coming, Sir." On which Audland, looking up at
the sign, observed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This dog he runs wi' his tail to the south,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But co' on the landlord, an' he'll gi' mouth."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Once when his landlady, at the Dog, had urged him to
clear off a long score, which he had run up at the house,
he gave her the following promissory note, which was
accepted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I, John Oldland,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Befoar I gang hence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Owe Betty Woodburn<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just six and two pence.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An', Thursday come sennet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll pay off the auld scoar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' wha knas but I may<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Spend twice as mich moar."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The smartest of John's rhymes was made on the occasion
of his being put to trouble (as it is properly termed in the
provincial dialect) by a lawyer, for some debt which he had
incurred at Ulverston; a proof that not only poets, but all
who meddle with rhyme, are poor. John repeated with
emphasis&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"God mead men,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">An' men mead money;<br /></span>
<span class="i8">God mead bees,<br /></span>
<span class="i10">An' bees mead honey;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the D&mdash;l mead lawyers an' tornies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' pleac'd 'em at U'ston and Daltan i' Forness."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We shall only have room to notice another of these
"rustic bards." He too was a Crosthwaite man, but of a
more recent date. We do not intend to insinuate that there
is any predisposing cause about Crosthwaite, that inclines
the inhabitants to rhyme, but it happens that we remember
these two at the present moment; by an association of
ideas, the one has probably conjured up the other.</p>

<p>Jamie Muckelt was undoubtedly the best rhymer in that
part of the country; and, consequently his rhymes have
been more carefully preserved than those of any other. We
have room, however, for only a few specimens.</p>

<p>Jamie was a farmer; and once, returning from the
market he had overset, or, as he called it, capsized the cart.
His wife was angry, and eagerly inquired the cause of such
an accident. Jamie, with that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">sang froid</i> for which he was
so remarkable, only replied,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Caerlessly, thou may depend&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pooin' away at t' helter end."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A common footpath led through a field in which Jamie
had a crop of pease one year. These held out a temptation,
Jamie considered, to passengers to be taking tithe in kind.
To prevent these depredations he fixed up a board, on
which he painted or chalked the following lines:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pray ye, nebbers, dunnet pull;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll gi' ye a pey-scode when they're full.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If ye it 'em when they're swash,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They'll fill yer belly full o' trash."<br /></span>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>
<p>Muckelt happened once to be at the Punch Bowl in
Crosthwaite, in company with Dr. Bell. Jamie's rhyming
abilities were pretty well known, and perhaps sometimes a
little envied. Be that as it may, the Doctor challenged
Jamie to rhyme him for a wager. Jamie, without a
moment's study, produced the following stanza:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"At your request,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I'll du me best;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ya' thing I implore&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If Dr. Bell<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Can du as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To trouble me no more."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Doctor acknowledged himself outdone, and paid his
forfeit.</p>

<p>On another occasion Jamie had staid at the Punch Bowl
till he was rather top-heavy, and fell into the fire and burnt
himself. The next day he went to the house to discharge
his bill, and gave them, in addition to their regular charge,
the following verse:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thear is some men, for want o' sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Will run ther sels to vast expense;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' I mesel, for want o' greace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fell into t' fire an' burnt me feace."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Meeting with a friend one day, in the shambles at
Kendal, he said,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Come, nebber, let us join,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou'll buy t' leg I'll buy t' loin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If thou'll buy t' head I'll buy t' pluck;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An' we'll hev a quart at t' Dog an' Duck."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Many other instances of this rhyming propensity, through
all the country, might be produced, would our limits
permit.</p>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-4">F</span>OUR miles from Penrith, near the road to Appleby,
and in the district which, to this day, bears the name
of Whinfell Forest, there formerly stood a fine oak,
which bore the name of Hart's-Horn Tree, a name it
acquired from a tradition to this effect. In the time of the
first Robert de Clifford, about the year 1333, Edward Baliol,
King of Scotland, came into Westmorland, and stayed some
time with that Lord, at his castles of Appleby, Brougham,
and Pendragon. During his visit they ran a stag by a
single greyhound, out of Whinfell Forest to Redkirke in
Scotland, and back again to the same place. Being both
spent, the stag leaped over the pales, and died there; but the
greyhound attempting to leap, fell, and died on the opposite
side. As a memorial of this incident, the stag's horns were
nailed upon a tree just by; and the dog being named
Hercules, this couplet obtained currency amongst the
people&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hercules kill'd Hart-a-grease,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a><br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="right blockquot"><cite>Song of Adam Bell.</cite></p>

<p>In course of time, it is stated, the horns became grafted, as
it were, upon the tree, by reason of its bark growing over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
their root, and there they remained more than three centuries,
till, in the year 1648, one of the branches was broken
off by some of the army; and ten years afterwards, the
remainder was secretly taken down by some mischievous
people in the night. "So, now," says Lady Ann Clifford, in
her <cite>Diary</cite>, "there is no part thereof remaining, the tree
itself being so decayed, and the bark of it so peeled off, that
it cannot last long; whereby we may see time brings
to forgetfulness many memorable things in this world, be
they ever so carefully preserved&mdash;for this tree, with the
hart's horn in it, was a thing of much note in these parts."</p>

<p>In another part of the same forest, which, like many other
forests in this country, as Skiddaw forest, Inglewood forest,
&amp;c., has no trace of what it has been but the name, there
stood, a few years ago, three enormous oak trees, known by
the name of the "Three Brothers." One of them measured
thirteen yards in girth.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-3">T</span>HE moon shone full upon the dial of Saint Paul's,
and showed the hour-pointer far advanced towards
midnight, as Edward Fletcher paused for a moment
to inquire the time, and then pursued his way
in deep and silent meditation. At an early age, by
the death of both his parents, he had been left to
the care of an unmarried uncle, who, after giving him
a good education, had placed him in a merchant's office,
and had since enabled him to become the principal of a
mercantile establishment. He had now been for two years
the master of a lucrative and increasing business, and
being naturally of a social disposition, he began to court the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
company of those of his own rank. In this way he had
spent the evening, and, having accompanied some of his
fair companions to their homes, he was returning to his
own lodgings in a distant part of the metropolis. The
warm and genial influence of Society had called into action
the softer emotions of his heart, freed them from the icy
fetters which long and arduous attention to business had
thrown over them, and caused them again to burst forth
and to roll onward in an unbroken current, bearing his
thoughts to that far distant period, when, in the twilight of
memory, the forms of past events are dim and indistinctly
visible.</p>

<p>And he lingered on the recollection with a melancholy
pleasure, for it was the happiest period of his existence.
He was then the loved and caressed of parents who were
now no more. Those joyous days were passed among the
pleasant hills and valleys of Westmorland, and now he was
confined among the din and bustle of the city. He remembered
one fair girl, who was more than his playmate, with
whom "he roamed about the braes," pulling the cowslips or
the early violets; or at evening sat under the shadow of a
spreading elm, telling her the stories which he had read
during the day, and listening to the little hymns which her
mother had taught her; but of her he knew nothing&mdash;she
too, probably, was with the dead.</p>

<p>Then he thought of his school-days, with their mischievous
tricks and their active sports, and their hard lessons, and
the noble boys who were his comrades. Some of them, the
gentlest and the most beloved, were also gone to their rest;
and the hardy, the active, and enterprising, were pursuing
their separate courses of adversity or success; many, like
himself, were still bachelors, whilst others enjoyed the
delights of domestic felicity in the bosoms of their families.
This last subject was one on which he had often deeply
pondered. Arrived at that time of life, when the enthusiasm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
of youth has subsided, before the indifference of age has
commenced, he had long felt the solitude of his orphan state;
he had been convinced that he did not move in the sphere
for which Providence had designed him.</p>

<p>He was alone, among strangers; he was exposed to the
thousand little discomforts which are inseparable from the
lot of him who has no place which he can feel to be a home.
He engaged in the duties of life without spirit or energy,
more in imitation of the example of others, than from any
heartfelt incitement to action. If prosperity smiled on him,
he viewed it with indifference, but the frowns of adversity
chilled and depressed him. He wished for some one to share
with him in the former, and, by participation, to render the
latter less irksome, instead of being compelled to feel the
whole weight of its gloom on his own mind, and to brood over
his misfortunes in cheerless solitude. His observation had
convinced him that marriage alone would give full zest to joy,
and soften the stings of sorrow; and now, his heart, softened
by the society which he had just left, and by his recollections
of former days, nourished and gradually matured the conviction,
till at length he firmly resolved to abjure the state, to
him miscalled, of "single-blessedness."</p>

<p>By this time he had reached his own door. He had
passed through one moon-lit street after another, occupied
with his own reflections, unheeding alike the artless laugh
of voice, the shout of the drunken reveller, and the noise
and tumult of the thronging crowd which poured from one
of the theatres.</p>

<p>"Yes," said he, "I'll marry." The rapper was in his
hand, and it fell with a heavy knock, as if sounding an
"Amen" to his recently-formed resolution.</p>

<p>He retired to his couch, but not to repose. His thoughts
continued to oppress and agitate him, and he tossed about
restless and sleepless. The hour of midnight, tolled from
the neighbouring belfry, had been succeeded by "the wee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
short hours ayont the twal," gradually lengthening and
announcing the dawn of day, before he fell into a short and
broken slumber. When he arose he sought his counting-house,
but the time passed slowly and heavily on. He
spent the day in a state of abstraction, relieved only by a
conviction that it was his duty to exert himself more than
ever. He would relapse for a while into indolence, and
then, suddenly rousing from his stupor, recommence his
employment with renewed but short-lived energy; and he
rejoiced when the approach of evening allowed him to
escape, and to accept the invitation of his friend, Charles
Manson, to walk with him in the Regent's Park.</p>

<p>Charles, who was some years his junior, and was studying
for the medical profession, was a youth of sanguine temperament&mdash;one
of those who love to view things on their bright
side; who sincerely enjoy the delights of life; and who, if
they are visited by affliction, feel it deeply for a time, but
soon forget it. He was in high spirits. The fineness of
the weather, the number and gay appearance of the company
in the Park, and his relaxation from the labours of the day,
all tended to enliven him, and animated his converse.
Scarcely an equipage rolled by, or a horseman passed them,
without furnishing him with occasion for an approving or
satirical remark. Edward, however, seemed not to heed his
observations, or, if he noticed them at all, it was by a cold
nod, or a single syllable of assent.</p>

<p>He passed in silence the various natural and architectural
beauties of the place, on which he was accustomed to dilate.
The fine Doric portico, and massive grandeur of the
Colosseum, the splendid facade of Cumberland Place, the
innumerable curiosities of the Zoological Gardens, and the
rural loveliness of the wooded lake, were alike unheeded.</p>

<p>At length Charles stopped, and, looking his companion
attentively in the face, said to him, "Edward, thou art in
love."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>"In love," he replied, with a feeble laugh, "not I indeed,
what can have given thee such an idea?"</p>

<p>"Thy remarkably grave deportment, moping abstraction,
and disregard for all that's worth seeing. Thou hast passed
unnoticed many of thy favourite subjects of remark; thou
hast allowed the most magnificent carriages, and some of
our greatest public characters, to pass thee unobserved,
coldly assenting to my words, or 'nodding thy head like a
mandarin in a tea-shop'&mdash;I am persuaded that thou art in love."</p>

<p>"Well, Charles, I own that, though not yet in love, I
trust I soon shall be, and that my love will be consummated
by lasting union. I have long compared the delights of
marriage with the discomforts of the bachelor, and last
night, bringing my notions to a point, I came to the resolution
to marry."</p>

<p>"Make no such rash resolve," said Charles, "but consider
the inconveniences as well as the comforts of matrimony.
For my own part, having given myself up to the pursuit of
study, I am satisfied that a wife would retard my progress.
It would be impossible for me to pay that undivided attention
to my profession, which my duty, not more than my
inclination demands. Few eminent men have been married.
The rule which prevents Roman Catholic clergymen from
being so, was doubtless the result of great experience and
deep conviction on the part of its framers, that it tended to
draw the thoughts from the functions of the sacerdotal
office. So study and celibacy for me; or if I be married,
let my library be my bride."</p>

<p>"And a wife and happiness for me!" replied Edward.
"What benefit is there in amassing a large store of knowledge,
which may never be required, and at the same time
neglecting the enjoyment of female society, and despising
its aid as the minister of virtue. The reasons which induce
thee to continue single do not affect me, and, in fact, I
should rather seek a wife to incite me to great exertion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
than merely continue in the spiritless pursuit of wealth or
knowledge."</p>

<p>"And what," asked Charles, "are the requisite qualities
of such a wife?"</p>

<p>"She must," said Edward, "be a woman whose virtues
are the fruit of religious conviction; she must be modest
without affectation, and cheerful without boldness; lovely
in person, and accomplished in mind."</p>

<p>"Let me try to guess who she is," said Charles; and he
named some of their female acquaintance who, he thought,
best answered the description.</p>

<p>But no! Edward's ideas of female excellence were so
refined, that none of these came up to the standard. Each
had some fault which might have passed unobserved by
others, but could not escape the discriminating eye of our
philosophic bachelor.</p>

<p>Lucy was "a blue stocking." She spent her time in the
study of foreign languages and abstruse sciences; and her
mind, occupied in such recondite pursuits, could not be
expected to bend to the homely and unpretending duties of
a household.</p>

<p>Elizabeth was "a butterfly:"&mdash;a giddy, thoughtless child
of nature, content with the powers which nature had
bestowed, and regardless of cultivating and improving them;
enjoying the present, as though it comprised the whole
period of her existence, and as if there would be no future
which called for preparation. An imprudent woman was
unsuitable for a wife.</p>

<p>Emma was "an egotist." All her regard seemed to be
spent upon her own person. She was constantly admiring
herself in the mirror, arranging some irregularity in the fold
of her kerchief, or some unevenness in her sleeves, or trying
some new posture to show her form to advantage: and she
who was filled with self-love would care little for the
happiness of her husband.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p>Mary ran into the opposite extreme. He admired
simplicity, but he disliked negligence. Some part of her
dress was often in disorder; a string was wanting in her
cap, or a lock of hair hung loosely over her forehead; and
neatness was an indispensable requisite for the partner of
his life.</p>

<p>Jane was "a chatter-box;" gay and volatile, her tongue
ran on in ceaseless prattle, without giving utterance to one
idea, the result either of observation or reflection. Her
words sounded prettily enough to the ear, but they left no
impression on the mind; and thought and foresight ought
to belong to every one who might become the head of a
family.</p>

<p>Judith was "a mere negation." She was, perhaps, blameless
in regard to the actual commission of offence, but she was
supine and indolent in virtuous exertion. If she did no
evil, she did little good. The course of her life was one
dead level, without rise and without depression. She acted
so as to save appearances with the world; but her heart
was a stranger to every generous impulse, her hand was
seldom stretched out in active benevolence, and her mind
was ignorant of the practical operation of religion and piety.
He looked to marriage for a stimulus to renewed exertion,
but he could expect no aid from one so listless and
apathetic.</p>

<p>"Most exact of men!" exclaimed Charles, "thy conduct
is a perfect anomaly. Attempting to reason on the most
illogical of all passions&mdash;laying down a proposition that
thou wilt marry, before falling in love, and finding fault
with those of the fair sex, who are admired and followed,
even by those who never wish to be lovers. Throw off
this fastidiousness; or, depend upon it, that it will be long
before thou art a husband, and before I am left alone in the
ranks of celibacy."</p>

<p>They parted&mdash;but the feeling daily increased and became<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
stronger in the mind of Edward. He sought society more
eagerly than ever; but though he felt a transient gratification
in its variety, he found, in the retrospect, nothing but
disappointment. He met with none on whom he could
centre his affections. Each had some fault which rendered
her unfit for a wife. He met with many whom he admired,
many whom he could respect as friends, but none
whom he could love with that fervour and singleness of
heart which he considered due to her whom he should make
his own. And yet he saw his companions select their
partners, and live apparently in married felicity. Even the
fair ones whom he had so severely criticised and censured,
were respectively united to admiring and joyous husbands.
Yet in vain did he seek for some pure, spotless being, who
might realize his opinion of the feminine character; love
seemed to be a tempting fruit hung beyond his reach. He
began to doubt whether he was not differently constituted
from the generality of his species, and incapable of their
susceptibilities; yet when he thought of his early affections
to his parents and the fair companion of his youth, and
when he referred to the feelings that even now burned in
his bosom, he was convinced that he only wanted the
opportunity to prove himself possessed of the finest sympathies
of humanity.</p>

<p>It was midsummer: the fashionable part of the community
had left London for their seats in the country,
and Edward, tired of its suffocating heat, its forsaken
squares, and desolate streets, resolved also to leave it, and
revisit, for the first time since his boyhood, the beautiful
scenery of his native Westmorland.</p>

<p>He took the coach to Kendal, and there left it; preferring
to proceed on foot, as allowing him greater liberty in choosing
his route, and in diverging from the high roads when
interest or curiosity might prompt him to wander. For a
week he rambled through the most picturesque districts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
the country, climbing its hills, while the exercise and the
bracing air improved his health; rowing on its lakes, and
treading its flowery meads, which spoke of peace and comfort
to his mind; or gazing on its waterfalls till his sorrow
and disquiet were forgotten in the contemplation. But
what were his feelings as he approached the place of his
nativity? He stole up the narrow lane that led to it from
the main road, and cautiously drew near. He thought that
the little croft behind was strangely diminished in size, and
that the house had an altered and more homely appearance
than he expected; yet over the arch-way were the initials
of his parents' names, "R. &amp; S. F., 1795."</p>

<p>He looked through the garden-gate, and at the well-known
door sat the mistress of the house, employed with
needlework, whilst a young child gambolled along the
walks. How often had his mother sat there, occupied in
the same manner, and smiled on his infant frolics! He
found that his parents were forgotten, and the names of the
neighbours were strange to him; even the heavy-clogged
hind, of whom he made the inquiry, who was homeward
"dragging his weary way," eyed him, as if half-suspicious
of some sinister intention. Amid all his distress, he had
been accustomed to reflect on that place, and on the early
days he had spent there, with feelings of pleasure: when
the clouds gathered blackest around him, he remembered
them as a gleam of sunshine in his existence, which, overcast
as it had been, might yet dispel the shades, and shed its
bright glory over the evening of his days. And thus to be
awakened to the sad reality, to find himself unknown on
the threshold of his father's house, an alien in the place of
his birth; to seek in vain for the friends of his youth; to
feel that he was alone in the world, and must buffet with it
single-handed; to find his last remaining solace depart, and
thus to become fully aware of the solitariness of his situation&mdash;convinced
him alike that he had drawn an overcharged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
picture of the past, and that doubt and uncertainty appertained
to the future&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He turned and left the spot;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, do not deem him weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For dauntless was that youthful heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Though a tear was on his cheek."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>He pursued his journey; and, on the morrow, after a long
ramble across the hills, reached a small and secluded village,
where he thought to remain for a day or two. After he had
dined, he went out to enjoy the fine views which its vicinity
afforded. The road lay along the side of a hill which, on
the one hand, was covered with heather, interspersed with
large stones, whose grey and wrinkled fronts looked out
from the purple blossoms dancing in the breeze, like age
surveying the pastimes of youth; and, on the other, was
bordered by trees, whose light waving branches gave an
occasional glimpse of the lake beyond them. A small
avenue opening it to the view, and offering a smooth bank
for his seat, he lay down to repose. The green boughs
overhead shaded him from the rays of the sun; before him,
in the distance, were some of Westmorland's loftiest hills,
standing boldly out in the clear blue sky, heathery-clad at
their tops, but, at their base, yellow with waving corn, green
with luxuriant pastures, or dark with extensive woods;
whence rose the smoke of the peasant's cot, the spire of a
village church, or the bold front of some magnificent mansion;
while, immediately before him, the lake spread its expanse
of beauty, its waters calm as a mirror, or curled by the
breeze into mimic and noiseless wavelets. A boat moved
slowly from behind one of the islands, rowed by one whose
dress showed him to be no professed sailor, and in the pause
between the grating of the oars on its side, and their splashing
in the water, the sound of a soft voice came in song
from a lady sitting at the stern. This "touched the string
on which hung all his sorrows."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>

<p>"And is there not," said he&mdash;"is there not some being
like that for me; is there none on earth to whom I may speak
of love? Am I, alone, of all my race doomed to drag
on a long and weary life, a solitary, friendless creature? I
have formed my notions of excellence at an elevation to
which human nature does not attain; I will banish these
vain ideas; lower my scale of excellence, as to the external
and less important parts of personal character, and return
into the world, determined to be pleased, to imitate the
example of my fellowmen, and, like them, to be happy."</p>

<p>He was roused by a voice near him, and, on turning, he
perceived a mendicant asking alms of a young plainly-dressed
lady. He arose from his recumbent posture, and,
for the first time, attracted her attention. She gave but
one enquiring glance, blushed deeply, slipped the money
hurriedly into the extended palm, and went on her way,
followed by the benedictions of the grateful sufferer.</p>

<p>By that mysterious principle, that sort of mental magnetism,
existing in every bosom, by which we are instantly
and unaccountably attracted to one whom we have never
seen before, but whom we feel an irresistible desire often to
meet&mdash;a feeling which time or distance may perhaps
diminish, but which nothing but death can extinguish&mdash;Edward
felt, as he returned to his inn, determined, if it
were possible, to have an interview with the fair stranger.
Often did she pass before him in the visions of the night;
often was his sleep broken by his dreams, but they were
dreams of happiness and joy.</p>

<p>The Sabbath morn called him to seek the meeting-house
of his sect, which was situate at a short distance from the
village. There it stood, with its gray walls and flagged
roof&mdash;its bright small-paned windows, and weather-beaten
door and shutters; its shade of arching lime-trees, and its
green grave-yard, surrounded by a low wall and an humble
wicket, on which the peasant might lean and moralise; for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
the dread of desecration which encircles the burial places in
cities with palisadoes and chevaux-de-frise had not reached
the inhabitants of that peaceful land. Its interior corresponded
with the neatness and simplicity of its outward
appearances. The walls seemed to have been recently
white-washed, and the sand on the floor cracked beneath
his tread, as he sought a seat on one of the old oaken forms.</p>

<p>Few were the assembled worshippers. An aged man,
dressed in the good old-fashioned drab coat, and three-decked
hat, from beneath which hung a few locks of reverend gray,
sat under the gallery, resting upon his staff; beneath him
was a stout, hale man, of the middle age, whose features
bespoke him to be his son, and whose wife was sitting on
the adjoining form. The seat parallel to that on which
Edward sat, contained some young women, whose features
he could not discern; and several, whose dress showed them
to be servants, or not connected with the body, were scattered
about on the back benches. But though small was the
assembly, and humble the place of gathering, whether it
arose from the quiet that reigned around, the effect of the
past week's journey, or the events connected with it, never
did Edward feel more of the pure spirit of devotion, never
did he retire from a house of worship more strengthened and
refreshed in spirit.</p>

<p>At the close of the meeting, the old friend kindly shook
him by the hand, and invited him to his house. Pleased
with his venerable appearance, and wishing to become
further acquainted with him, Edward accepted the invitation.</p>

<p>"Come," said the ancient, "thou's stronger nor me, let
me lean on thy airm;" and, thus supported on the one hand,
and with his stick in the other, they walked at a slow pace
through two or three fields, and then found themselves at
his door. His house was of brick, overgrown in the front
with large pear-trees, whose dark foliage strongly contrasted
with the clean white windows. A small plot before it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
defended by a green paling, was filled with pinks, roses,
campanulas, and other summer flowers; at the one end
a large, well-stocked orchard extended down the hill-side
beyond which, in the distance, were seen the blue waters of
the lake; and, at the other, was the farm-yard, with its
various out-buildings, its herds of lowing cattle, and troops
of poultry. The old man introduced his son, who had
arrived before them, by the name of James Summers, and
then turning to Edward, said, "but as I don't knaw tha
name, I can only half perform my duty."</p>

<p>"My name," he said "is Edward Fletcher."</p>

<p>"From thy dialect," said the son, "I suppose thou art
from London."</p>

<p>"Yes, I live there at present, but I was born at Rockgill,
about twelve miles to the west of this place."</p>

<p>"What!" inquired the son, "was thy father's name
Richard Fletcher?"</p>

<p>"It was," Edward replied, "but he has been long dead."</p>

<p>"I know he has; he was an intimate friend of ours; in
fact we were his next neighbours, till the advanced age and
increasing infirmities of my father, rendered it necessary for
me to assist in the management of his farm. I am heartily
glad to see thee; thou must protract thy stay with us, for
we have been too long separated to part soon."</p>

<p>"Ay," added his wife, "many a time have I dandled thee
on my knee when a child, and Eliza and thou used to
wander about together from morning till night."</p>

<p>"What's getten them?" asked the old man, "they are
langer nor common in comin' in."</p>

<p>As he spoke the door opened, and the sisters entered the
room.</p>

<p>"Why," said the old man, "ye ran off to-day, and didn't
come an' help me hame as ye used to do!"</p>

<p>"O! grandfather," said Eliza, "we saw thou wast too
well assisted to need our aid."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ay, and wha think ye my helper was?&mdash;naebody else
but Edward Fletcher, that used to play wi' thee when ye
were bairns, and that thou sae often talks aboot."</p>

<p>Edward observed her blush deeply at this remark. He
had at once recognized her as the lady who had yesterday
crossed his path, and as he now accosted her, he felt all his
prepossessions in her favour incalculably increased. Her
personal appearance was very pleasing. She was rather
tall. Her form was slender and graceful, and her complexion
exceedingly fair. Her chestnut hair was parted on her
forehead, a few stray tresses escaped from the border of her
cap, and her light blue eyes sparkled with innocent cheerfulness
and unobtrusive benevolence. Her sister, a few years
younger, was also a lovely girl, but her form and features
were less fully developed.</p>

<p>Placed on this footing, Edward soon felt himself at home,
and was delighted with the family into whose society he
had fallen; but his observation was chiefly directed to the
elder daughter. The more he saw, and the more he conversed
with her, the more strongly did she rivet his affections.
He found her possessed of a naturally strong, and highly-cultivated
mind, stored with knowledge of the most useful
kind; with a sweet and gentle disposition, and with a heart
in which religion and virtue held supreme place. As he
conversed with her, and found that her language breathed
of an intellectual and religious spirit, he thought that in
her were gathered all the qualities which he had so long
sought for in vain. But it was not till the cool of the day,
when they walked together by the lake, that he became
fully aware of the change which the events of the last
twenty-four hours had wrought upon him.</p>

<p>He was with her, whose mere glance had spoken to his
inmost heart; her who was the playmate of his infancy&mdash;the
only human being, except his parents, to whom he had
ever looked with a higher feeling than that of esteem: he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
found that his first impression was increased by future
acquaintance; that her features feebly shadowed forth her
mental excellence, her modesty, good sense, and religious
feeling;&mdash;he was with her in his native land at the close of
that day, when, if the mind may be allowed to dwell upon
any earthly feeling, it is upon that of honourable youthful
love, the most purified of mortal passions. They talked of
the joys of former days, of the many little incidents which
formed the chain of remembrance of their past pleasure, of
the mutual thoughts of each other which had lingered in
their bosoms; and before the expiration of Edward's sojourn
the foundation was laid of a connection which might only
terminate with life.</p>

<p>He returned to the metropolis an altered man. His
gloom and abstraction had vanished, and he pursued his
vocation with redoubled assiduity. But still his heart was
absent in "the north countrie," and many a journey did he
take thither, no longer to admire the beauty of its scenery,
but to indulge himself with the company of her, whose lot
in after life was to be bound up with his own. She accepted
the offer of his hand; the consent of her parents was asked
and received, the requisite formalities gone through, and
the necessary arrangements completed, when he asked his
friend Charles to accompany him to his marriage. After
some demur, on account of the pressing nature of his
studies, and the difference of opinion between them as to
the propriety of the step, Charles consented to go with him.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the house, they were of course
warmly welcomed. The morrow was appointed for the
wedding, and, as many relatives had been invited from
distant parts, great preparations were making for their
accommodation. Eliza seized the opportunity of stealing
away, unobserved, once more to visit her chosen walks
and favourite seats, and to bid adieu to the scenes where
she had spent the blissful days of youth. When she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
returned, she retired to her room, and having thrown off
her bonnet and gloves, she pondered on the circumstances
of her present situation. She was about to leave a peaceful
home, tender parents, and affectionate friends; but to-morrow
she would be a bride: she would gain one who
was more to her than all these, who would cherish and
protect her; and the tear that trickled adown her cheek,
was gilded by the beam of a pure and subdued love. Then,
turning her thoughts to Him who made, and had preserved
her, she uttered a sincere and fervent prayer for his continued
mercy and protection.</p>

<p>Never, perhaps, was the old meeting-house so filled as on
the morning of the marriage. Besides the procession of
friends and relatives from the house, the neighbours had
gathered from far and near to witness the nuptial ceremony
of one who was universally respected and beloved: and though
there were none of those signs of outward show by which
such occasions are commonly distinguished, though there
was no firing of cannon, no ringing of bells, no flying of
flags, yet it was not less a union of two faithful hearts, nor
did their vow of "affection until death" sound less solemnly
and impressively on the ears of the hushed assembly.</p>

</div></div>

<p>Edward found in wedlock all the happiness of which he
was in quest; nay, in his relation of a husband and a
parent, he partook of many a heartfelt joy, and many a dear
and tender feeling, which, in his days of speculative
bachelorhood, he was not able to anticipate. No longer a
dweller among strangers, living in the cold and cheerless
atmosphere of a hired lodging, and meeting only from the
other inmates of the house with that common-place regard
which exists between those who have little community of
feeling, he was happy in the delights of his home, in the
smiles of his child, in the warm affection of his loved and
lovely wife. He no longer sought the company of others as
a relief from his cares; he found an enchaining attraction to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
his own fireside. No longer neglectful, or indifferent to the
result of his mercantile engagements, he entered upon them
with increased ardour, not with the base and grovelling
view of amassing unprofitable wealth, but as an honourable
employment, affording him the means of supporting those
who are dependent upon him, and of relieving the distresses
of his fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>In difficulty, his wife was a constant, judicious adviser.
She endeavoured to mitigate his afflictions, she attended
him with unremitting care in sickness, she heightened his
joys, and alleviated his sorrows. Her intellectual endowments
qualified her to be his companion in study, and she
trod with him the humbler walks of literature and science.
Her mild and amiable disposition softened every harsh and
unkind feeling of his heart, while her piety assisted him in
endeavouring to perform those high and holy duties which
man owes to his Maker. No longer ill at ease with himself
or the world, he became a useful member of the great human
family, desirous of fulfilling his allotted part, by engaging
actively in schemes of philanthropy, and in the exercise of
a pure, unostentatious benevolence.</p>

<p>So apparent, indeed, was his happiness, that it was soon
rumoured even of Charles Manson, that, having become a
convert to his opinions, and being convinced that domestic
life is the surest source of present happiness, and a genial
nursery of those qualities which fit us for future felicity,
had taken more than one trip among the green hills of
Westmorland, in quest of a companion for life.</p>

<p>My tale is simple, but so are truth, and virtue, and
happiness; and to enforce this moral is the purpose of my
story. I might have filled my canvas with the brilliant
colours and iris tints of romance and fiction; but the eye of
the spectator would have been dazzled, and he would have
found nothing on which to rest his gaze: the chaste and
sober hues of truth alone are healthful to the mental sight.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
If in this humble colouring I have so traced the picture of
Edward and Eliza, as to show that marriage is one of the
first of blessings, and that its joys, though removed from
the superficial and fastidious, may yet be attained by the
simple and sincere; if I have at all shown what are the
qualities to be sought for in a virtuous wife, and how, and
where they may be found; if thus my humble page shall
have shed a beam of hope over the desponding and the
solitary, its object will be attained.</p>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-3">J</span>OHN HATFIELD, who acquired the appellation of the
Keswick Impostor, and whose extraordinary villany
excited universal hatred, was born in 1759, at Mortram,
in Cheshire, of low parentage, but possessing great
natural abilities. His face was handsome, his person
genteel, his eyes blue, and his complexion fair.</p>

<p>After some domestic depredations&mdash;for in his early days
he betrayed an iniquitous disposition&mdash;he quitted his family,
and was employed as traveller to a linen-draper in the north
of England. In the course of this service, he became
acquainted with a young woman, who was nursed, and
resided at a farmer's house in the neighbourhood of his
employer. She had been, in her earlier life, taught to
consider the people with whom she lived as her parents.
Remote from the gaieties and follies of polished life, she
was unacquainted with the allurements of fashion, and
considered her domestic duties as the only object of her
consideration. When this deserving girl had arrived at a
certain age, the honest farmer explained to her the secret of
her birth; he told her, that, notwithstanding she had always
considered him as her parent, he was, in fact, only her poor
guardian; and that she was the natural daughter of Lord
Robert Manners, who intended to give her £1000, provided
she married with his approbation.</p>

<p>This discovery soon reached the ears of Hatfield; he
immediately paid his respects at the farmer's, and having
represented himself as a young man of considerable expectations
in the wholesale linen business, his visits were not
discountenanced. The farmer, however, thought it incumbent
on him to acquaint his lordship with a proposal made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
to him by Hatfield, that he would marry the young woman,
if her relations were satisfied with their union, but on no
other terms. This had so much the appearance of an
honourable and prudent intention, that his lordship, on
being made acquainted with the circumstances, desired to
see the lover. He accordingly paid his respects to the
noble and unsuspecting parent, who, conceiving the young
man to be what he represented himself, gave his consent at
the first interview; and, the day after the marriage took
place, presented the bridegroom with a draft on his banker
for £1,500. This took place about 1771 or 1772.</p>

<p>Shortly after the receipt of his lordship's bounty, Hatfield
set off for London; hired a small ph&aelig;ton; was perpetually
at the coffee-houses in Covent Garden; described himself to
whatever company he chanced to meet, as a near relation
of the Rutland family; vaunted of his parks and hounds;
but as great liars have seldom good memories, he so varied
in his descriptive figures, that he acquired the appellation
of <em>Lying Hatfield</em>.</p>

<p>The marriage portion now exhausted, he retreated from
London, and was scarcely heard of for about ten years, when
he again visited the metropolis, having left his wife, with
three daughters, to depend on the precarious charity of her
relations. Happily she did not long survive; and the
author of her calamities, during his stay in London, soon
experienced calamity himself, having been arrested, and
committed to King's Bench prison, for a debt amounting to
the sum of £160. Several unfortunate gentlemen, then
confined in the same place, had been of his parties when he
flourished in Covent Garden, and perceiving him in great
poverty, frequently invited him to dinner; yet such was
his unaccountable disposition, that notwithstanding he knew
there were people present who were thoroughly acquainted
with his character, still he would continue to describe his
Yorkshire park, his estate in Rutlandshire, settled upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
his wife, and generally wind up the whole with observing
how vexatious it was to be confined at the suit of a paltry
tradesman for so insignificant a sum, at the very moment
when he had thirty men employed in cutting a piece of
water near the family mansion in Yorkshire.</p>

<p>At the time Hatfield became a prisoner in the King's
Bench, the unfortunate Valentine Morris, formerly governor
of St. Vincent's, was confined in the same place. This
gentleman was frequently visited by a clergyman of the
most benevolent and humane disposition. Hatfield soon
directed his attention to this good man, and one day
earnestly invited to attend him to his chamber; after some
preliminary apologies, he implored the worthy pastor never
to disclose what he was going to communicate. The divine
assured him the whole should remain in his bosom. "Then,"
said Hatfield, "you see before you a man nearly allied to
the house of Rutland, and possessed of estates (here followed
the old story of the Yorkshire park, the Rutlandshire
property, &amp;c., &amp;c.,); yet notwithstanding all this wealth,
continued he, I am detained in this wretched place for the
insignificant sum of £160. But the truth is, Sir, I would
not have my situation known to any man in the world but
my worthy relative, his Grace of Rutland. Indeed, I would
rather remain a captive for ever. If you would have the
goodness to pay your respects to this worthy nobleman, and
frankly describe how matters are, he will at once send me
the money by you; and this mighty business will not only
be instantly settled, but I shall have the satisfaction of
introducing you to a connection which may be attended
with happy consequences."</p>

<p>The honest clergyman readily undertook the commission;
paid his respects to the Duke, and pathetically
described the unfortunate situation of his amiable relative.
His Grace of Rutland, not recollecting at the moment such
a name as Hatfield, expressed his astonishment at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
application. This reduced the worthy divine to a very
awkward situation, and he faltered in his speech, when he
began making an apology; which the Duke perceiving, he
very kindly observed, that he believed the whole was some
idle tale of an impostor, for that he never knew any person
of the name mentioned, although he had some faint recollection
of hearing Lord Robert Manners, his relation, say
that he had married a natural daughter of his to a tradesman
in the north of England, and whose name he believed
was Hatfield.</p>

<p>The Reverend was so confounded that he immediately
retired and proceeded to the prison, where he gave the
impostor, in the presence of Mr. Morris, a most severe
lecture. But the appearance of this venerable man, as his
friend, had the effect which Hatfield expected; for the
Duke sent to inquire if he was the man that married the
natural daughter of Lord Robert Manners, and, being
satisfied as to the fact, despatched a messenger with £200,
and had him released.</p>

<p>In 1784, his Grace of Rutland was appointed Lord
Lieutenant of Ireland; and shortly after his arrival in
Dublin, Hatfield made his appearance in that city. He
immediately, on his landing, engaged a suite of rooms
at a hotel in College Green, and represented himself
as nearly allied to the Viceroy, but that he could not
appear at the castle until his horses, servants, and carriages
were arrived, which he ordered, before leaving England,
to be shipped at Liverpool. The easy and familiar
manner in which he addressed the master of the hotel,
perfectly satisfied him that he had a man of consequence
in his house, and matters were arranged accordingly. This
being adjusted, Hatfield soon found his way to Lucas's
coffee-house, a place which people of a certain rank
generally frequent; and, it being a new scene, the Yorkshire
park, the Rutlandshire estate, and the connection with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
the Rutland family, stood their ground very well for about
a month.</p>

<p>At the expiration of this time, the bill at the hotel
amounted to £60 and upwards. The landlord became
importunate, and after expressing his astonishment at the
non-arrival of Mr. Hatfield's domestics, etc., requested he
might be permitted to send in his bill. This did not in the
least confuse Hatfield; he immediately told the master of
the hotel, that very unfortunately his agent, who received
the rents of his estates in the north of England, was then
in Ireland, and held a public employment; he lamented
that his agent was not then in Dublin, but he had the
pleasure to know his stay in the country would not
exceed three days. This satisfied the landlord; and at the
expiration of the three days, he called upon the gentleman
whose name Hatfield had given him, and presented the
account. Here followed another scene of confusion and
surprise. The supposed agent of the Yorkshire estate very
frankly told the man who delivered the bill, that he had
no other knowledge of the person who sent him than what
common report furnished him with, that his general
character in London was that of a romantic simpleton whose
plausibilities had imposed on several people, and plunged
himself into repeated difficulties.</p>

<p>The landlord retired, highly thankful for the information,
and immediately arrested his guest who was lodged in
the prison of the Marshalsea. Hatfield had scarcely
seated himself in his new lodgings, when he visited the
jailor's wife in her apartment, and in a whisper, requested
of her not to tell any person that she had in her custody a
near relation of the then Viceroy. The woman, astonished
at the discovery, immediately showed him into the best
apartment in the prison, had a table provided, and she, her
husband, and Hatfield, constantly dined together, for nearly
three weeks, in the utmost harmony and good humour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>During this time he had petitioned the Duke for another
supply, who, apprehensive that the fellow might continue
his impositions in Dublin, released him, on condition of his
immediately quitting Ireland; and his grace sent a servant,
who conducted him on board the packet that sailed the next
tide for Holyhead.</p>

<p>In 1792, he came to Scarbro', introduced himself to the
acquaintance of several persons of distinction in that neighbourhood,
and insinuated that he was, by the interest of the
Duke of Rutland, soon to be one of the representatives in
parliament for the town of Scarbro'. After several weeks'
stay at the principal inn, his imposture was detected by his
inability to pay the bill. Soon after his arrival in London,
he was arrested for this debt, and thrown into prison. He
had been eight years and a half in confinement, when a
Miss Nation, of Devonshire, to whom he had become known,
paid his debts, took him from prison, and gave him her hand
in marriage.</p>

<p>Soon after he was liberated, he had the good fortune to
prevail with some highly respectable merchants in Devonshire
to take him into partnership with them; and, with a
clergyman to accept his drafts to a large amount. He made
upon this foundation a splendid appearance in London;
and, before the general election, even proceeded to canvass
the rotten burgh of Queenborough. Suspicions in the
meantime arose, in regard to his character, and the state of
his fortune. He retired from the indignation of his
creditors, and was declared a bankrupt, in order to bring
his villanies to light. Thus, having left behind his
second wife and two infant children at Tiverton, he visited
other places; and, at length, in July, 1802, arrived at the
Queen's Head in Keswick, in a handsome travelling carriage,
but without any servant, where he assumed the name of the
Hon. Alexander Augustus Hope, brother of the Earl of
Hopetoun, M.P., for Linlithgow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>From Keswick, as his head-quarters, he made excursions
in every direction amongst the neighbouring valleys; meeting,
generally, a good deal of respect and attention, partly
on account of his handsome equipage, and still more from
his visiting cards, which designated him as "the Honourable
Alexander Augustus Hope." Some persons had discernment
enough to doubt of this; for his breeding and
deportment, though showy, had a tinge of vulgarity about it;
he was grossly ungrammatical in his ordinary conversation.
He received letters under this assumed name&mdash;which might
be through collusion with accomplices&mdash;but he himself
continually franked letters by that name. That being a
capital offence, not only a forgery, but (as a forgery on the
post-office) sure to be prosecuted, nobody presumed to
question his pretensions any longer; and henceforward, he
went to all places with the consideration attached to an
earl's brother. All doors flew open at his approach; boats,
boatmen, nets, and the most unlimited sporting privileges,
were placed at the disposal of the "Honourable" gentleman;
and the hospitality of the whole country taxed itself to offer
a suitable reception to the patrician Scotchman.</p>

<p>Nine miles from Keswick, by the nearest route, lies the
lake of Buttermere. Its margin, which is overhung by
some of the loftiest and steepest of Cumbrian mountains,
exhibits on either side few traces of human neighbourhood;
the level area, where the hills recede enough to allow of any,
is of a wild, pastoral character, or almost savage; the waters
of the lake are deep and sullen; and the barrier mountains,
by excluding the sun for much of its daily course, strengthen
the gloomy impressions. At the foot of this lake (that is,
at the end where its waters issue), lie a few unornamented
fields, through which rolls a little brook-like river, connecting
it with the larger lake of Crummock; and at the edge of
this little domain, upon the roadside, stands a cluster of
cottages, so small and few, that, in the richer tracts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
islands, they would scarcely be complimented with the name
of hamlet. One of these, the principal, belonged to an
independent proprietor, called, in the local dialect, a
"Statesman;" and more, perhaps, for the sake of gathering
any little local news, than with much view to pecuniary
profit at that era, this cottage offered the accommodations
of an inn to traveller and his horse.</p>

<p>Rare, however, must have been the mounted traveller in
those days, unless visiting Buttermere for itself, for the
road led to no further habitations of man, with the exception
of some four or five pastoral cabins, equally humble, in
Gatesgarth dale. Hither, however, in an evil hour for the
peace of this little brotherhood of shepherds, came the cruel
spoiler from Keswick, and directed his steps to the once
happy cottage of poor Mary, the daughter of Mr. and Mrs.
Robinson, an old couple, who kept the inn, and had, by
their industry, gained a little property. She was the only
daughter, and probably her name had never been known to
the public, but for the account given of her by the author
of <cite>A Fortnight's Ramble to the Lakes in Westmorland,
Lancashire, and Cumberland</cite>. His errand was to witness
or share in char-fishing; for in Derwentwater (the lake of
Keswick) no char is found, which breeds only in the deeper
waters, such as Windermere, Crummock, Buttermere, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hatfield now became acquainted with an Irish gentleman,
an M.P., who had been resident with his family some months
at Keswick. With this gentleman, and under his immediate
protection, there was likewise a young lady of family and
fortune, and of great personal attractions. One of the
means which Hatfield used to introduce himself to this
respectable family was the following:&mdash;Understanding that
the gentleman had been a military man, he took an army
list from his pocket, and pointed to his assumed name, the
Honourable Alexander Augustus Hope, lieutenant-colonel of
the 14th regiment of foot. This new acquaintance daily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
gained strength; and he shortly paid his addresses to the
daughter of the above gentleman, and obtained her consent.
The wedding clothes were bought; but previously to the
wedding-day being fixed, she insisted that the pretended
Colonel Hope should introduce the subject formally to her
friends. He now pretended to write letters; and, while
waiting for the answers, proposed to employ that time in a
trip to Lord Hopetoun's seat, &amp;c.</p>

<p>From this time he played a double game; his visits to
Keswick became frequent, and his suit to the young lady
assiduous and fervent. Still, however, both at Keswick and
Buttermere, he was somewhat shy of appearing in public.
He was sure to be engaged in a fishing expedition on the
day on which any company was expected at the public house
at Buttermere; and he never attended the church at
Keswick but once.</p>

<p>Finding his schemes baffled to obtain this young lady and
her fortune, he now applied himself wholly to gain possession
of Mary Robinson, who was a fine young woman of eighteen,
and acted as waiter. In a situation so solitary, the stranger
had unlimited facilities for enjoying her company, and
recommending himself to her favour. Among the neighbours
he made the most minute inquiries into every circumstance
relating to her and her family. Doubts about his
pretensions never arose in so simple a place as this; they
were over-ruled before they could well have arisen, by the
opinion now general in Keswick, that he really was what
he pretended to be; and thus, with little demur, except in
the shape of a few natural words of parting anger from a
defeated or rejected rustic admirer, the young woman gave
her hand in marriage to the showy and unprincipled stranger.
He procured a licence, and they were married in the church
of Lorton, on the 2nd of October, 1802. A romantic account
of the circumstance found its way almost immediately into
the newspapers. It thus fell under the notice of various<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
individuals in Scotland, who knew that Colonel Hope, who
was said to have married the flower of Buttermere, had been
abroad the whole summer, and was now residing in Vienna.
Mr. Charles Hope, then Lord Justice Clerk, afterwards
President of the Court of Session (a son-in-law of the Earl
of Hopetoun), made the fact known, and prompted inquiries
which led to the detection of the imposture.</p>

<p>On the day previous to his marriage, Hatfield wrote to
Mr. Mansfield, informing him, that he was under the necessity
of being absent for ten days on a journey into Scotland,
and sent him a draft for thirty pounds, drawn on Mr.
Crumpt, of Liverpool, desired him to cash it, and pay some
small debts in Keswick with it, and send him over the
balance, as he feared he might be short of cash on the road.
This Mr. Mansfield immediately did, and sent him ten
guineas in addition to the balance. On the Saturday, Wood,
the landlord of the Queen's Head, returned from Lorton with
the public intelligence, that Colonel Hope had married the
Beauty of Buttermere. As it was clear, whoever he was,
that he had acted unworthily and dishonourably, Mr.
Mansfield's suspicions were of course awakened. He
instantly remitted the draft to Mr. Crumpt, who immediately
accepted it. Mr. Mansfield wrote to the Earl of
Hopetoun. Before the answer arrived, the pretended
honourable returned with his wife to Buttermere. He
went only as far as Longtown, when he received two letters,
seemed much troubled that some friends whom he had
expected had not arrived there, stayed three days, and then
told his wife that he would again go back to Buttermere.</p>

<p>From this she was seized with fears and suspicions. They
returned, however, and their return was made known at
Keswick. The late Mr. Harding, the barrister, and a Welsh
judge, passing through Keswick, heard of this impostor, and
sent his servant over to Buttermere with a note to the
supposed Colonel Hope, who observed, "that it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
mistake, and that it was for a brother of his." However,
he sent for four horses, and came over to Keswick; drew
another draft on Mr. Crumpt for twenty pounds, which the
landlord at the Queen's Head had the courage to cash. Of
this sum he immediately sent the ten guineas to Mr.
Mansfield, who came and introduced him to the judge, as
his old friend Colonel Hope. But he made a blank denial
that he had ever assumed the name. He had said his name
was Hope, but not that he was the honourable member for
Linlithgow, &amp;c., &amp;c.; and one who had been his frequent
intimate at Buttermere gave evidence to the same purpose.</p>

<p>In spite, however, of his impudent assertions, and those
of his associate, the evidence against him was decisive. A
warrant was given by Sir Frederick Vane on the clear proof
of his having forged and received several franks as the
member for Linlithgow; and he was committed to the care
of a constable, but allowed to fish on the lake. Having,
however, found means to escape, he took refuge for a few
days on board a sloop off Ravenglass, and then went in the
coach to Ulverston, and was afterwards seen at a hotel in
Chester. In the meantime the following advertisement,
setting forth his person and manners, was in the public
prints:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">"Notorious Impostor, Swindler, and Felon!</p>

<p>"John Hatfield, who lately married a young woman,
commonly called the Beauty of Buttermere, under an
assumed name; height about five feet ten inches, aged about
forty-four, full face, bright eyes, thick eyebrows, strong, but
light beard, good complexion, with some colour, thick, but
not very prominent nose, smiling countenance, fine teeth, a
scar on one of his cheeks near his chin, very long thick
light hair, and a great deal of it gray, done up in a
club; stiff, square-shouldered, full breast and chest, rather
corpulent, and strong limbed, but very active; and has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>rather a spring in his gait, with apparently a little hitch in
bringing up one leg; the two middle fingers of his left hand
are stiff from an old wound; he has something of the Irish
brogue in his speech; fluent and elegant in his language,
great command of words, frequently puts his hand to his
heart; very fond of compliments, and generally addressing
himself to persons most distinguished by rank or situation;
attentive in the extreme to females, and likely to insinuate
himself where there are young ladies. He was in America
during the war; is fond of talking of his wounds and
exploits there, and of military subjects, as well as of
Hatfield Hall, and his estates in Derbyshire and Cheshire;
and of the antiquity of his family, whom he pretends to
trace to the Plantagenets. He makes a boast of having
often been engaged in duels; he has been a great traveller
also, by his own account, and talks of Egypt, Turkey, and
Italy; and, in short, has a general knowledge of subjects,
which, together with his engaging manners, is well calculated
to impose on the credulous. He had art enough to
connect himself with some very respectable merchants in
Devonshire, as a partner in business, but having swindled
them out of large sums, he was made a separate bankrupt
in June, 1802. He cloaks his deception under the mask of
religion, appears fond of religious conversation, and makes
a point of attending divine service and popular preachers."</p>

<p>Besides blighting the prospects of the poor girl, he had
nearly ruined her father by running up a debt of eighteen
pounds. His dressing-case, a very elegant piece of furniture,
was left behind, and on being opened at Keswick by warrant
of a magistrate, was found to contain every article that the
most luxurious gentleman could desire, but no papers tending
to discover his real name. Afterwards, Mary herself, searching
more narrowly, discovered that the box had a double
bottom, and in the intermediate recess, found a number of
letters addressed to him by his wife and children, under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
name of Hatfield. The story of the detection immediately
became as notorious as the marriage had been.</p>

<p>Though he was personally known in Cheshire to many of
the inhabitants, yet this specious hypocrite had so artfully
disguised himself, that he quitted the town without any
suspicions before the Bow Street officers reached that place
in quest of him. He was then traced to Brielth, in Brecknockshire,
and was at length apprehended about sixteen
miles from Swansea, and committed to Brecon jail. He had
a cravat on, with his initials, J. H., which he attempted to
account for by calling himself John Henry.</p>

<p>Before the magistrates he declared himself to be Ludor
Henry; and in order to prepossess the honest Cambrians in
his favour, boasted that he was descended from an ancient
family in Wales, for the inhabitants of which country he
had ever entertained a sincere regard. He was, however,
conveyed up to town by the Bow Street officers, where he
was examined on his arrival before the magistrates. The
solicitor for his bankruptcy attended to identify his person,
and stated, that the commission of bankruptcy was issued
against Hatfield in June, 1802; that he attended the last
meeting of the commissioners, but the prisoner did not
appear, although due notice had been given in the <cite>Gazette</cite>,
and he himself had given notice to the prisoner's wife, at
Wakefield near Tiverton, Devon. Mr. Parkyn, the solicitor
to the Post-office, produced a warrant from Sir Frederick
Vane, Bart., a magistrate for the county of Cumberland,
against the prisoner, by the name of the Hon. Alexander
Augustus Hope, charging him with felony, by pretending to
be a member of parliament of the United Kingdom, and
franking several letters by the name of A. Hope, to several
persons, which were put into the Post-office at Keswick, in
Cumberland, in order to evade the duties of postage.
Another charge for forgery, and the charge for bigamy, were
explained to him, but not entered into, as he was committed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
for trial for these charges at the next assizes at Carlisle.
He conducted himself with the greatest propriety during his
journey to town, and on his examination; but said nothing
more than answering a few questions put to him by Sir
Richard Ford and the solicitors, affecting to consider himself
a persecuted individual, and representing, in particular, that,
in the alliance with Mary Robinson, he had been rather
sinned against than sinning. Mary, on the other hand, who
was now announced to be likely to bear a child to her
pretended husband, refused to become accessory to his
prosecution. The utmost she could be prevailed on to do
against Hatfield was to address the following letter to Sir
Richard Ford:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The man whom I had the misfortune to marry, and who
has ruined me and my aged parents, always told me he
was the Hon. Colonel Hope, the next brother of the Earl
of Hopetoun. Your grateful and unfortunate servant,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">Mary Robinson</span>."</p>
</div>

<p>At the fourth examination of the impostor, on the 27th
of December, this letter was read aloud by the clerk, in the
open court. To quote from a chronicle of the time:&mdash;"The
simplicity of this letter, which, though it breathes the soft
murmur of complaint, is free from all virulence, excited in
the breast of every person present an emotion of pity and
respect for the unmerited sorrows of a female, who has in
this whole matter manifested a delicacy of sentiment, and
nobleness of mind, infinitely beyond her sphere of education.
The feelings of Hatfield could not be enviable; yet he
exhibited no symptom of contrition; and when remanded
for further examination, retired with the most impenetrable
composure."</p>

<p>He was then dressed in a black coat and waistcoat, fustian
breeches, and boots, and wore his hair tied behind. His
appearance was respectable, though quite in dishabille.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
The Duke of Cumberland, and several other gentlemen,
were present at his examination; in the course of which
the following letter was produced:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="right">
"<span class="smcap">Buttermere</span>, <em>Oct.</em> 1, 1802.
</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have this day received Mr. Firkman's
kind letter from Manchester, promising me the happiness of
seeing you both in about ten days, which will indeed give
me great pleasure; and you can, too, be of very valuable
service to me at this place, particulars of which, when we
meet, though I shall probably write to you again in a few
days. The chief purpose for which I write this, is to desire
you will be so good as to accept a bill for me, dated Buttermere,
the 1st of October, at ten days, and I will either give
you cash for it here, or remit to you in time, whichever way
you please to say. It is drawn in favour of Nathaniel
Montgomery More, Esq. Be pleased to present my best
respects to your lady; and say, I hope, ere the winter
elapses, to pay her my personal respects; for if you will
manage so as to pass a little time with me in Scotland, I
will promise to make Liverpool in my way to London.
With the truest esteem, I am, Dear Sir, yours ever,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="smcap">A. Hope</span>."</p>

<p class="blockquot">
"<span class="smcap">Keswick</span>, <em>October the 1st, 1802</em>.<br />

</p>
</div>

<p>This letter, it was proved, passed free of postage. Another
letter was also produced from his wife at Tiverton, and a
certificate of his marriage with Mary of Buttermere. His
trial came on August 15th, 1803, at the Assizes for Cumberland,
before the Honourable Alexander Thompson, Knt.
He stood charged upon the three following indictments:&mdash;</p>

<p>1. With having assumed the name and title of the Honourable
Alexander Augustus Hope, and pretending to be a
member of parliament of the United Kingdom of Great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
Britain and Ireland; and with having, about the month of
October last, under such false and fictitious name and
character, drawn a draft or bill of exchange, in the name of
Alexander Hope, upon John Crumpt, Esq., for the sum of
£20, payable to George Wood, of Keswick, Cumberland, innkeeper,
or order, at the end of fourteen days from the date
of the said draft or bill of exchange.</p>

<p>2. With making, uttering, and publishing as true, a
certain false, forged, and counterfeit bill of exchange, with
the name of Alexander Augustus Hope thereunto falsely
set and subscribed, drawn upon John Crumpt, Esq., dated
the 1st of October, 1802, and payable to Nathaniel
Montgomery More, or order, ten days after date, for £30
sterling.</p>

<p>3. With having assumed the name of Alexander Hope,
and pretending to be a member of parliament of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, the brother of the
right Hon. Lord Hopetoun, and a colonel in the army; and
under such false and fictitious name and character, at various
times in the month of October, 1802, having forged and
counterfeited the hand-writing of the said Alexander Hope,
in the superscription of certain letters or packets, in order
to avoid the payment of the duty on postage.</p>

<p>The prisoner pleaded not guilty to the charge.</p>

<p>The three several indictments having been read, Mr.
Scarlett opened the case in an address to the jury; and gave
an ample detail of the prisoner's guilt.</p>

<p>In support of what he had advanced, he called Mr. Quick,
who was clerk in the house at Tiverton, where Hatfield was
partner, who swore to his hand-writing. The Rev. Mr.
Nicholson swore that when the prisoner was asked his
name, he said it was a comfortable one&mdash;Hope.</p>

<p>The evidence for the prosecution having closed, the
prisoner addressed himself to the jury. He said he felt
some degree of satisfaction in being able to have his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
sufferings terminated, as they must of course be by their
verdict. For the space of nine months he had been dragged
from prison to prison, and torn from place to place, subject
to all the misrepresentations of calumny.</p>

<p>"Whatever will be my fate," said he, "I am content; it
is the award of justice, impartially and virtuously administered.
But I will solemnly declare that in all my transactions,
I never intended to defraud or injure the persons whose
names have appeared in the prosecution. This I will
maintain to the last of my life."</p>

<p>After the evidence was gone through, his lordship, Sir A.
Thompson, summed up the whole of the evidence and commented
upon such parts as peculiarly affected the fate of
the prisoner. "Nothing," said his lordship, "could be more
clearly proved, than that the prisoner did make the bill or
bills in question under the assumed name of Alexander
Augustus Hope, with an intention to defraud. That the
prisoner used the additional name of Augustus was of no
consequence in this question. The evidence proved clearly
that the prisoner meant to represent himself to be another
character; and under that assumed character, he drew the
bills in question. If anything should appear in mitigation
of the offences with which the prisoner was charged, they
must give them a full consideration; and though his
character had been long shaded with obloquy, yet they
must not let this in the least influence the verdict they
were sworn to give."</p>

<p>The jury consulted about ten minutes, and then returned
a verdict&mdash;Guilty of Forgery.</p>

<p>During the whole of the trial the court was excessively
crowded. The prisoner's behaviour was proper and dignified;
and he supported his situation from first to last with
unshaken fortitude. He employed himself, during the
greatest part of his trial, in writing notes on the evidence
given, and in conversing with his counsel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>When the verdict of the jury was given, he manifested no
relaxation of his accustomed demeanour. After the court
adjourned, he retired from the bar, and was ordered to attend
the next morning to receive the sentence of the law. The
crowd was immense; and he was allowed a post-chaise from
the town-hall to the jail.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>At eight o'clock the next morning, the court met again,
when the prisoner appeared at the bar to receive his sentence.
Numbers of people gathered together to witness this painful
duty of the law passed upon one whose appearance, manners,
and actions, had excited a most uncommon degree of interest.
After proceeding in the usual form, the judge addressed the
prisoner in the following impressive terms:&mdash;</p>

<p>"John Hatfield, after the long and serious investigation
of the charges which have been preferred against you, you
have been found guilty by a jury of your country.</p>

<p>"You have been distinguished for crimes of such magnitude,
as have seldom, if ever, received any mitigation of
capital punishment; and in your case, it is impossible it can
be limited. Assuming the person, name, and character, of a
worthy and respectable officer of a noble family in this
country, you have perpetrated and committed the most
enormous crimes. The long imprisonment you have undergone
has afforded time for your serious reflection, and an
opportunity for your being deeply impressed with a sense of
the enormity of your crimes, and the justness of that sentence
which must be inflicted upon you; and I wish you to be
seriously impressed with the awfulness of your situation. I
conjure you to reflect with anxious care and deep concern
on your approaching end, concerning which much remains
to be done. Lay aside now your delusions and impositions,
and employ properly the short space you have to live. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>beseech you to employ the remaining part of your time in
preparing for eternity, so that you may find mercy at the
hour of death, and in the day of judgment. Hear, now, the
sentence of the law:&mdash;That you be carried from hence to
the place from whence you came, and from thence to the
place of execution, and there to be hung by the neck till you
are dead; and may the Lord have mercy on your soul!"</p>

<p>A notion very generally prevailed that he would not be
brought to justice; and the arrival of the mail was daily
expected with the greatest impatience. No pardon arriving,
Saturday, September 3, 1803, was at last fixed upon for the
execution.</p>

<p>The gallows was erected the preceding night, between
twelve and three, on an island formed by the river Eden,
on the north side of the town, between the two bridges.
From the hour when the jury found him guilty, he behaved
with the utmost serenity and cheerfulness. He talked upon
the topics of the day with the greatest interest or indifference.
He could scarcely ever be brought to speak of his
own case. He neither blamed the verdict, nor made any
confession of his guilt. He said he had no intention to
defraud those whose names he forged; but was never heard
to say that he was to die unjustly. None of his relations
ever visited him during his confinement.</p>

<p>The alarming nature of the crime of forgery, in a commercial
country, had taught him, from the beginning, to
entertain no hope of mercy. By ten in the morning of
September 3, his irons were struck off; he appeared as
usual, and no one observed any alteration or increased
agitation whatever.</p>

<p>Soon after ten o'clock he sent for the <cite>Carlisle Journal</cite>,
and perused it for some time. A little after he had laid
aside the paper, two clergymen (Mr. Pattison of Carlisle and
Mr. Mark of Burgh-on-Sands), attended and prayed with
him for about two hours, and drank coffee with him. After<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
they left him, about twelve, he wrote some letters, and in
one he enclosed his penknife; it was addressed to London.
About this time he also shaved himself; though intrusted
with a razor, he never seems to have meditated an attempt
upon his life; but it was generally reported on Friday night
that he had poisoned himself, though without foundation.
To all who spoke with him, he pretended that what he had
to suffer was a matter of little consequence. He preferred
talking on indifferent subjects. At three, he dined with
the jailer, and ate heartily. Having taken a glass or two
of wine, he ordered coffee. He took a cup a few minutes
before he set out for the place of execution. The last thing
he did was to read a chapter from the 2d Corinthians. He
had previously marked out this passage for his lesson before
he was to mount the scaffold.</p>

<p>The sheriffs, the bailiffs, and the Carlisle volunteer cavalry,
attended at the jail door about half-past three, together
with a post-chaise and hearse. He was then ordered into
the turnkey's lodge, for the purpose of being pinioned,
where he inquired of the jailer, who were going in the
chaise with him? He was told the executioner and the
jailer. He immediately said, "Pray, where is the executioner?
I should wish much to see him." The executioner was sent
for. Hatfield asked him how he was, and made him a
present of some silver in a paper. During the time of his
being pinioned, he stood with resolution, and requested he
might not be pinioned tight, as he wished to use his handkerchief
on the platform; which was complied with. A
prodigious crowd had assembled; this was the market day,
and people had come from the distance of many miles out
of mere curiosity. Hatfield, when he left the prison, wished
all his fellow-prisoners might be happy; he then took
farewell of the clergyman, who attended him to the door of
the chaise, and mounted the steps with much steadiness and
composure. The jailer and executioner went in along with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
him. The latter had been brought from Dumfries upon a
retaining fee of ten guineas.</p>

<p>It was exactly four o'clock when the procession moved
from the jail. Passing through the Scotch gate, in about
twelve minutes it arrived at the Sands. Half the yeomanry
went before the carriage, and the other half behind. Upon
arriving on the ground, they formed a ring round the
scaffold. It is said that he wished to have the blinds drawn
up, but that such an indulgence was held inconsistent with
the interest of public justice. When he came in sight of the
tree, he said to the jailer, he imagined that was the tree
(pointing at it) that he was to die on. On being told yes,
he exclaimed, "O! a happy sight&mdash;I see it with pleasure!"</p>

<p>As soon as the carriage-door had been opened by the
under-sheriff, he alighted with his two companions. A
small-cart, boarded over, had been placed under the gibbet,
and a ladder was placed against it, which he instantly
ascended. He was dressed in a black jacket, black silk
waistcoat, fustian pantaloons, shoes, and white cotton stockings.
He was perfectly cool and collected. At the same
time, his conduct displayed nothing of levity, of insensibility,
or of hardihood. He was more anxious to give proof
of resignation than of heroism. His countenance was
extremely pale, but his hand never trembled. He immediately
untied his neckerchief, and placed a bandage over his
eyes. Then he desired the hangman, who was extremely
awkward, to be as expert as possible about it, and that he
would wave a handkerchief when he was ready. The
hangman, not having fixed the rope in its proper place, he
put up his hand and turned it himself. He also tied his
cap, took his handkerchief from his own neck, and tied it
about his head also. Then he requested the jailer would
step on the platform and pinion his arms a little harder,
saying, that when he had lost his senses he might attempt
to lift them to his neck. The rope was completely fixed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
about five minutes before five o'clock; it was slack, and he
merely said, "May the Almighty bless you all." Nor did
he falter in the least, when he tied the cap, shifted the rope,
and took his handkerchief from his neck.</p>

<p>He several times put on a languid and piteous smile.
He at last seemed rather exhausted and faint. Having
been near three weeks under sentence of death, he must
have suffered much, notwithstanding his external bearing;
and a reflection of the misery he had occasioned must have
given him many an agonizing throb.</p>

<p>Having taken leave of the jailer and sheriff, he prepared
himself for his fate. He was at this time heard to exclaim,
"My spirit is strong, though my body is weak."</p>

<p>Great apprehensions were entertained that it would be
necessary to tie him up a second time. The noose slipped
twice, and he fell down about eighteen inches. His feet at
last were almost touching the ground; but his excessive
weight, which occasioned this accident, speedily relieved
him from pain. He expired in a moment, and without any
struggle. The ceremony of his hands being tied behind his
back, was satisfied by a piece of white tape passed loosely
from one to the other; but he never made the smallest
effort to relieve himself. He had calculated so well, that
his money lasted exactly to the scaffold. As they were
setting out, the hangman was going to search him. He
threw him half-a-crown, saying,</p>

<p>"This is all my pockets contain."</p>

<p>He had been in considerable distress before he received a
supply from his father. He afterwards lived in great style,
frequently making presents to his fellow felons. He was
considered in the jail as a kind of emperor; he was allowed
to do whatever he pleased, and no one took offence at the
air of superiority which he assumed.</p>

<p>He was cut down after he had hung about an hour. On
the preceding Wednesday he had applied to one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
clergymen who attended him, to recommend him a tradesman
to make his coffin. Mr. Bushby, of Carlisle, took
measure of him. He did not appear at all agitated while
Mr. Bushby was so employed; but told him that he wished
the coffin to be a strong oak one, plain and neat.</p>

<p>"I request, Sir," he added, "that after I am taken down,
I may be put into the coffin immediately, with the apparel
I may have on, and afterwards closely screwed down, put
into the hearse which will be in waiting, carried to the
churchyard, and be interred in the evening."</p>

<p>A spot was fixed upon in a distant corner of the churchyard,
far from the other tombs. No priest attended, and
the coffin was lowered without any religious service.
Notwithstanding Hatfield's various and complicated
enormities, his untimely end excited considerable commiseration.
His manners were extremely polished and
insinuating, and he was possessed of qualities which might
have rendered him an ornament to society.</p>

<p>The unfortunate Mary of Buttermere went from home
to avoid the impertinent visits of unfeeling curiosity. She
was much affected; and, indeed, without supposing that
any part of her former attachment remained, it is impossible
that she could view his tragical fate with indifference.
When her father and mother heard that Hatfield had
certainly been hanged, they both exclaimed, "God be
thanked!"</p>

<p>On the day of his condemnation, Wordsworth and
Coleridge passed through Carlisle, and endeavoured to
obtain an interview with him. Wordsworth succeeded;
but, for some unknown reason, the prisoner steadily refused
to see Coleridge; a caprice which could not be penetrated.
It was true that he had, during his whole residence at
Keswick, avoided Coleridge with a solicitude which had
revived the original suspicions against him in some quarters,
after they had generally subsided. However, if not him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
Coleridge saw and examined his very interesting papers.
These were chiefly letters from women whom he had
injured, pretty much in the same way, and by the same
impostures, as he had recently practised in Cumberland.
Great was the emotion of Coleridge when he afterwards
recurred to these letters, and bitter&mdash;almost vindictive&mdash;was
the indignation with which he spoke of Hatfield. One
set of letters appeared to have been written under too certain
a knowledge of his villany towards the individual to whom
they were addressed; though still relying on some possible
remains of humanity, or perhaps (the poor writer might
think) on some lingering relics of affection for herself.</p>

<p>The other set was even more distressing; they were
written under the first conflicts of suspicions, alternately
repelling with warmth the gloomy doubts which were fast
arising, and then yielding to their afflicting evidence; raving
in one page under the misery of alarm, in another courting
the delusions of hope, and luring back the perfidious
deserter&mdash;here resigning herself to despair, and there again
labouring to show that all might yet be well. Coleridge
said often, in looking back upon that frightful exposure of
human guilt and misery, that the man who, when pursued
by these heart-rending apostrophes, and with this litany of
anguish sounding in his ears, from despairing women, and
from famishing children, could yet find it possible to enjoy
the calm pleasures of a lake tourist, and deliberately to
hunt for the picturesque, must have been a fiend of that
order which, fortunately, does not often emerge amongst
men.</p>

<p>It is painful to remember that, in those days, amongst
the multitudes who ended their career in the same
ignominious way, and the majority for offences connected
with the forgery of bank notes, there must have been a
considerable number who perished from the very opposite
cause; namely, because they felt, too passionately and profoundly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
for prudence, the claims of those who looked up to
them for support. One common scaffold confounds the
most flinty hearts and the tenderest. However, in this
instance, it was in some measure the heartless part of
Hatfield's conduct which drew upon him his ruin; for the
Cumberland jury, it has been asserted, declared their
unwillingness to hang him for having forged a frank; and
both they, and those who refused to aid his escape, when
first apprehended, were reconciled to this harshness entirely
by what they had heard of his conduct to their injured
young fellow-countrywoman.</p>

<p>She, meantime, under the name of the Beauty of Buttermore,
became an object of interest to all England. Dramas
and melo-dramas were produced in the London theatres
upon her story; and for many a year afterwards, shoals of
tourists crowded to the secluded lake and the little homely
cabaret, which had been the scene of her brief romance. It
was fortunate for a person in her distressing situation, that
her home was not in a town; the few and simple who had
witnessed her imaginary elevation, having little knowledge
of worldly feelings, never for an instant connected with her
disappointment any sense of the ludicrous, or spoke of it as
a calamity to which her vanity might have co-operated.
They treated it as unmixed injury, reflecting shame upon
nobody but the wicked perpetrator. Hence, without much
trial to her womanly sensibilities, she found herself able to
resume her situation in the little inn; and this she continued
to hold for many years. In that place, and in that
capacity, she was seen repeatedly. She was greatly admired,
and became the subject of the poet's song; but "sorrow," to
use the beautiful language of Ossian, "sorrow, like a cloud
on the sun, shaded her soul."</p>

<span class="smaller">OR, A FIGHT IN BORROWDALE.</span></h2>


<div>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-5">I</span>N olden time, when the contiguous countries of England
and Scotland held no amicable relation to each other,
it may well be supposed that the mountain ridges
forming the line of demarcation between the two territories
would frequently be the scene of fierce contention between
a rival people. The proximity of the English and Scots in
the neighbourhood of the border line, and the inoperative
character of the laws, arising from the disorders of the
feudal system, which filled both countries with chiefs and
petty governors, eager, and sufficiently powerful, to make
aggressions and reprisals on each other, are of themselves
a sufficient explanation of the causes which led to those
continued strifes called the Border warfare. The deep
enmity of the hostile parties towards each other overthrew,
in a good measure, all moral obligation and honourable
feeling.</p>

<p>Incursions were frequently made from the north, less for
the purpose of contention in arms, than for committing
depredations on cattle and property. Hence the name of
freebooters came to be applied to the Border clans, and
ultimately with much justice; for in course of time it was
deemed matter of indifference by either party whether they
preyed on their rival neighbours, or on their own countrymen.
Instances are, however, on record in which the Border
feuds were distinguished by a romantic and chivalrous
feeling, that may well be supposed to have animated great
and noble minds, in an age when the most powerful sceptre<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
was the sword, and martial prowess the most estimable
quality of mankind:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Those were the days, the olden days<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When Border feuds ran high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the men of the North ofttimes sallied forth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On deeds of chivalry.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O! heaven gie rest to the souls of a'<br /></span>

<span class="i2">On baith sides o' the Border."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Summoning forth "far forgotten things," we will refer to
a desperate struggle between two rival clans of Border
freebooters, under the stupendous rocks of Honister Crag
and Yew Crag.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, at the autumnal season of a year
over which passing centuries have thrown a darkening veil,
the weary and harassed Borderers of Borrowdale were
summoned together by the sound of the slogan, or war-cry
of their band. The scouts, who had been sent forth in
different directions, to give timely notice of any hostile
approaches, returned to their chief, who sat ruminating by
his watch-fire, on a neighbouring mountain, and reported
the sudden irruption of the Scottish clan, that had swept
before them a rich booty of cattle, lying at the foot of
Borrowdale hawse. By passing in small companies through
well-reconnoitred passes of the mountains, the Scots had
contrived to elude the observation of the night guard, till
their whole force had again united. They then divided into
two companies, one of which drove their booty towards the
frontier, and the other remained to protect the rear, and
baffle their opponents, if they attempted pursuit. The
war-shout of the despoiled clan rung through the mountains,
and the Cumberland men repaired one and all to their chief,
each one mounted on his pricker&mdash;a name applied to their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
small horses&mdash;which were both fleet and sufficiently spirited
to overcome a laborious ascent into the hills.</p>

<p>Among the Scottish freebooters none were found possessed
of greater skill and daring, in the management of their
predatory excursions, than the Gr&aelig;mes. This clan it was
who had undertaken and accomplished the capture of
Borrowdale, which even in those days of enterprise, was
looked upon as an astonishing instance of successful temerity.
These troopers were commanded by the younger Gr&aelig;me, a
bold, hardy chieftain; and his aged father, the Ossian of the
clan, followed in all their expeditions to infuse warlike
feeling into their hearts, by reciting "the tale of other
times," and the bold enterprises of his past days, when the
feebleness of age had not arrived.</p>

<p>All the Border clans cherished feelings of deadly animosity
against each other; and this hereditary hate was even
greater than their desire for plunder. When the division
of the Highland band, under the direction of the two
Gr&aelig;mes, had succeeded in diverting the enemy from the
track which their comrades had taken, they separated
among the hills, there to wait the signal, when a favourable
opportunity should present for rushing down in all their
strength upon the Cumberland men, and working out the
measure of their hatred against them.</p>

<p>After fruitless attempts to recover the spoils which had
been wrested from them, the English Borderers resolved to
retaliate on the Scottish frontier; and, accordingly, collecting
all their power, commenced their march through the
desolate region of Borrowdale. Information was speedily
conveyed to the younger Gr&aelig;me, that the enemy were
approaching. The appointed signal was then given, and
the Highlanders once more crowded round their leader.
The Scottish chief determined to suspend his attack till the
enemy should arrive in the defile between Honister Crag
and Yew Crag, when his followers would have the advantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
of assailing their foe from the overhanging precipices.
They marched along in single rank, through the passes of
the mountains, towards the appointed spot, singing their
favourite war-song:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sons of the mountain chief, on to the battle-field!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clansmen and Highlanders, grasp ye the sword and shield;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the rock or in defile, we'll not be ensnared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the foe is awaiting, are we not prepared?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">On, let us meet them, our bucklers shall cover us;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our refuge the hills, and heaven's vault over us:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O'er the steep of the crag, down the side of the scar,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us rush on the foe, in the thunder of war.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Their bugles sound cheerly: Behold them advancing!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With waving of plumes, and their chargers all prancing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet the mountains that ring to their proud horses' tread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They shall echo ere long to the fall of the dead!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Highlanders concealed themselves behind the rocky
fragments strewn on the side of Yew Crag, till the English,
advancing at a rapid rate, had reached the point in
Gatesgarthdale, which lay directly opposite to their ambuscade.
Young Gr&aelig;me sprung on his feet, and waved his
claymore towards the enemy. The signal was answered by
a volley of musketry from the hill; and instantly several
horses, without riders, flew through the defile. The elder
Gr&aelig;me singled forth the English leader. Sinking on one
knee, he raised his musket with deadly certainty, and ere
the sound of the death-shot could reach his victim, the
white steed that bore him was left unfettered by the rein.</p>

<p>Furious at the loss of their leader, the troopers wheeled
their horses round the precipice on which the Gr&aelig;mes and
a few of their followers were stationed; and before the
remainder of the Highland band could afford succour, the
younger Gr&aelig;me, together with several of his clan, had met<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
the death of heroes. The English then dashed forward on
their expedition, not caring to continue the battle under
the disadvantages of their position.</p>

<p>The Highlanders gathered round their fallen leader, and
raised loud lament for the warrior, whose blood was streaming
in their view. The old chieftain gazed wildly on his
son; and his frame, which seventy winters had not palsied,
shook with tremor. The body was laid in an opening on
the hill-side, and every clansman brought a fragment of
rock, to raise a rude memorial to his chief. On the summit
of the pile they placed his bonnet, shield, and claymore,
that neither friend nor foe should thereafter pass it with
irreverence.</p>

<span class="smaller">A PARISH CHARACTER.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_j.png" width="24" height="70" alt="J" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-3">J</span>OSEPH ROBINSON, better known by the name of
"Jossy with Whips," was a well-known character in
the parish of Orton in Westmorland. He had his
regular rounds, which he constantly travelled; and his
accustomed houses, where his never-failing alms was duly
received by this self-instituted collector.</p>

<p>Some are still living who can recollect the harmless idiot
and all his singular accoutrements. He never appeared
without six or eight whips in his hands: a little stick, with
a piece of string attached to the end of it, would any time
supply honest Joseph with an excellent whip. A piece of
an old coat, tied to his body with a hayband, was his usual
upper garment; his legs were usually covered with haybands,
tier above tier; and a profusion of hemp strings, in
his opinion, adorned his person. These simple ornaments
were to Joseph as dear and as honourable as the red and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
blue ribbons which are so anxiously struggled for by his
fellows in the higher walks of life. In his hat he wore
a fox's brush and peacock feathers, thus aping the fancied
splendour of eastern magnificence.</p>

<p>Jossy was a quiet, inoffensive being; and the farmers
through all the south of Westmorland would as soon have
thought of neglecting any of their just debts, as of refusing the
accustomed donation made to him. An out-house was his
usual place of lodging; and habit had rendered this so
natural to him, that a bed never entered his circumscribed
ideas.</p>

<p>After Joseph, like his intelligent fellow-mortals, had been
consigned to his "narrow house," a young man, in the
parish of Orton, composed the following elegy to his
memory:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Beneath this lowly, grass-encircled spot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lie the remains of Joseph of the Knot.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death, grisly tyrant, no distinction shows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twixt him who all, and him who nothing knows.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yes, ye! ye mighty sons of boasted wit!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All&mdash;all, like Joseph, must to death submit.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though on his fingers many a ring he bore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And round his brow the gaudy honours wore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For him his plumes although the peacock shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And reynard's brush graced Joseph's hoary head;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though armed with whips he constantly appeared,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Death mocked his honours, nor his armour feared.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ah! despise not Joseph's humble lot&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His life so mean&mdash;his death so soon forgot:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the last day&mdash;that great decisive day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When death shall yield his temporary prey&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By lords, by kings, his fate may be desired&mdash;<br /></span>

</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-1">A</span>BOUT a quarter of a mile from Lyulph's Tower, a
hunting seat of the late Duke of Norfolk, on the
banks of Ullswater, is a lonely brook, the Airey or
Aira, which, at Aira Force, falls over the rocks a
height of 80 feet, into a beautiful and deep glen, covered
with luxuriant foliage of fern and sweet-scented hawthorns.
A picturesque bridge unites the precipitous rocks down
which the foaming torrent pursues its ceaseless course.</p>

<p>This beautiful waterfall is the scene of the touching
legend of the "Somnambulist," which has been versified by
Wordsworth. The tale is, that Emma, a beautiful lady,
betrothed to one Sir Eglamore, was walking in her sleep
on the banks of the fall; and that her lover, who had unexpectedly
returned after a long absence&mdash;so long as to
have affected her health&mdash;was struck with the apparition
of the maid, who had become subject to night wanderings.
He watched her for some time plucking the twigs from the
trees, and casting them into the stream, uncertain whether
she were a real object, or a mere phantom of his imagination.
He touched her, and, suddenly breaking her slumber, the
affrighted maid shrieked, and, starting back, fell down the
rocks into the stream below. The knight plunged in after
her, and rescued her; but, though consciousness returned
for a short period, and she recognised him, she expired
within a few minutes upon the bank. The heart-broken
knight built a cell upon the edge of the fall, and lived there
in solitude for several years, shunning all intercourse with
the world.</p>

<span class="smaller">A LEGEND OF THE VALE OF ST. JOHN.</span></h2>


<div>
  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/drop_i.png" width="21" height="70" alt="I" />
</div>

<p class="drop-cap in0"><span class="drop-cap-5">I</span>N travelling from Ambleside to Keswick, after passing
Wythburn Chapel, the high road winds by the base of
Helvellyn and the margin of the Lake of Thirlmere,
or Leatheswater, which latter it afterwards leaves by
a very steep ascent, exhibiting, in all their grandeur, the
Fells of Borrowdale. Arrived at the top of this ascent, a
very exquisite landscape presents itself below, extending
over the Vale of Legberthwaite; or, more euphoniously and
modernly, the Vale of St. John's.</p>

<p>In the midst of this valley is a fantastic pile of rocks,
which, from their resemblance to the walls and towers of
a dilapidated and time-worn fortress, are known as the
Castle Rock. Hutchinson, in his <cite>Excursion to the Lakes</cite>,
describes this singular scene with much poetic feeling.
"We now gained the Vale of St. John's," he says, "a very
narrow dell, hemmed in by mountains, through which a
small brook makes many meanderings, washing little
enclosures of grass-ground, which stretch up the rising of
the hills. In the widest part of the dale you are struck
with the appearance of an ancient ruined castle, which
seems to stand upon the summit of a little mount, the
mountains around forming an amphitheatre. This massive
bulwark shows a front of various towers, and makes an
awful, rude, and Gothic appearance, with its lofty turrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
and ragged battlements; we traced the galleries, the bending
arches, the buttresses. The greatest antiquity stands
characterised in its architecture; the inhabitants near it
assert it is an antediluvian structure.</p>

<p>"The traveller's curiosity is roused, and he prepares to
make a nearer approach, when that curiosity is put upon
the rack by his being assured that, if he advances, certain
genii who govern the place, by virtue of their supernatural
art and necromancy, will strip it of all its beauties, and, by
enchantment, transform the magic walls. The vale seems
adapted for the habitation of such beings; its gloomy
recesses and retirements look like haunts of evil spirits.
There was no delusion in the report; we were soon convinced
of its truth; for this piece of antiquity, so venerable
and noble in its aspect, as we drew near changed its figure
and proved no other than a shaken massive pile of rocks,
which stand in the midst of this little vale, disunited from
the adjoining mountains, and have so much the real form
and resemblance of a castle, that they bear the name of the
Castle Rocks of St. John."</p>

<p>"The inhabitants to this day," says Mackay, "believe
these rocks to be an antediluvian structure, and assert that
the traveller, whose curiosity is aroused, will find it
impossible to approach them, as the guardian genii of the
place transform the walls and battlements into naked rocks
when any one draws near." Nothing, in the whole range
of mythological fable, could be more beautiful than this
popular superstition, which ascribes the disappearance of
"the castle," on a near approach, to supernatural agency.
Frigid philosophy would say, these fragments of rock, when
viewed from afar, bear strong resemblance to an old
fortress; but on approaching nearer the illusion vanishes,
and they are found to be a shapeless mass of stone. Poetry
clothes this fact in beautiful imagery; she warns the
intruder to survey the structure at a distance; for should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
he have the temerity to advance upon it, the incensed genii
of the place will, by spells "of power to cheat the eye with
blear illusion," transform its fair proportions into a mis-shapen
pile of rocks. This pleasing fiction emanated from
the same poetical spirit that wrought, in the elder days of
Greece, the splendid fable of Aurora, in her saffron-coloured
robe, opening the gates of the morning to the chariot of
the sun.</p>

<p>The genius of Sir Walter Scott has rendered the beautiful
Vale of St. John classic ground, by having selected it for
the principal scene of his "Bridal of Triermain." This is
purely a tale of chivalry of Arthur's days, when midnight
fairies danced the maze; and it is at the fantastic Castle
Rock that Sir Walter represents King Arthur's amorous
dalliance with its fairy inhabitants in their halls of enchantment,
when he was on his way to Carlisle. Our limits will
not admit the whole of "The Bridal of Triermain." We give,
however, such portions as will sufficiently connect the
thread of the narrative, in which it will be observed that
Sir Roland de Vaux, the Baron of Tremain, is introduced.
This branch of Vaux, with its collateral alliances, is now
represented by the family of Braddyl, of Conishead Priory,
near Furness Abbey.</p>

forty days to any inhabitant of the parish of Crossthwaite, that should
attend the Vicar to St. Herbert's Isle, on the 13th of April, yearly, that
being the anniversary of his death, there to celebrate mass in memory of
St. Herbert. Processions and ceremonies of this kind had, in those days,
a powerful effect on the minds of the lower orders of society. Perhaps it
was better they should have some religion, though tinctured with a degree
of superstition, than have been possessed of minds irreverent towards
heaven, and souls totally absorbed in the darkness of ignorance, and given
up to gross licentiousness.</p></div>

<p>The Leeza is a river which flows into the lake of Ennerdale; on issuing

sixty paces in circumference, with openings, or approaches, directly opposite

the embankment around for the convenience of the spectators.</p></div>
